## <Icon icon="cube" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this feature?

You can now build on top of even more LLMs in Playlab! There are now 8 available AI models for you to build your Playlab apps on top of. We will try our best to always provide the latest models for you to build on top of.

<Warning>
  Changing the LLM may impact the performance of your app.
</Warning>

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Rationale for the feature

This feature allows Playlab users to experiment with and leverage the unique strengths of various AI models from different providers all within Playlab.

As you build, you might find that certain models perform better at different tasks. This will allow Playlab users to select the model that fits their needs better. The more available models, the more likely you are to find one that meets your needs. We believe that Playlabbers should have access to frontier models as we build in community.

## <Icon icon="key" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> How do I access these models?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the LLM selector">
    On the top left click the LLM. (By default it will say GPT-4o)
    
    <img height="500" src="/images/Selectinganllm.gif" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your model">
    From the menu, select which LLM you want to build on top of.

## <Icon icon="wand-magic-sparkles" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Tips for Selecting the Right Model

Selecting can be tricky. That's why we encourage you to play and experiment as you build to find the model that is best fit for your context.

### <Icon icon="scale-balanced" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Selection Considerations

<Accordion title="Ask yourself what is an ideal response time for your app?">
  This will allow you to pick larger or smaller models that meet those needs
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Identify what complexity level is your task?">
  * For simple Q&A or content generation, lighter models may suffice
  * For multi-step reasoning, choose reasoning-focused models
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the level of accuracy you are requiring of your app?">
  * Critical accuracy use cases like data analysis, or HR operations might require more powerful models even if they're slower.
  * Use cases that require creativity or open ended responses might not call for reasoning models and may work better with more well balanced models.
</Accordion>

### <Icon icon="medal" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Best Practices

<Accordion title="Try to match your model with your use case:">
  * Creative applications – Choose models with creative strengths like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, 3.7 Sonnet, GPT 4o
  * Problem-solving tools – Select reasoning-focused models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Reasoning) or o1
  * Educational explanation – Consider specialized models like Llama 3.3 or those with strong explanatory capabilities
  * High-volume applications – Balance quality with speed using models like Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet or Gemini 2 Flash
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test out multiple models for apps that you are building:">
  * Changing a model may change performance of an app in Playlab
  * Test multiple models before finalizing – Performance can vary significantly on your specific tasks
  * Implement A/B testing as you're building and testing to continually evaluate model performance
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Additional best practices:">
  * We recommend that you remix apps as you're experimenting to not impact the original app
  * You can review activity to see how multiple models handle similar tasks
  * If you're building a suite of apps we recommend you use faster models for simple queries and reserve powerful models for complex tasks
</Accordion>

## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> FAQ

<Accordion title="Will switching models affect my existing app?">
  Yes, changing the LLM model can impact the performance of your app. Different models have different strengths and trade-offs, so it's important to test your app with the new model before finalizing the change.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I know which model is best for my specific use case?">
  We recommend experimenting with different models for your specific use case. Consider factors like response time requirements, complexity level of tasks, and accuracy needs. You can implement A/B testing to evaluate model performance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use different models for different parts of my app suite?">
  Yes! We recommend using faster models for simple queries and reserving more powerful models for complex tasks if you're building a suite of apps.
</Accordion>
