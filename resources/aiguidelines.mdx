This document provides guidance for the responsible and ethical use of Playlab in your districts, schools, and classrooms. We want to empower educators to best leverage AI for their contexts to improve teaching and learning. However, as with any new technology, it's important to be mindful of potential risks and ensure that Playlab AI is used in ways that are educational, safe, secure, and ethical.

<Warning>
  Implementation of Playlab AI tools should align with your school or district's specific policies, privacy requirements, and educational goals. These guidelines should be adapted to your unique context.

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Guiding Principles

The following guidance considers key principles for ethical AI use in education, adapted specifically for Playlab implementation in educational contexts:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Academic Excellence">
    We support the use of Playlab AI in the classroom to improve the teaching & learning experience for all members of the school community. Productive use of Playlab in the academic setting includes:
    - Collaboration prior to using Playlab apps
    - Transparency between educators & learners about which Playlab apps are being used and why
    - Providing Playlab specific implemention Professional Development and best practices to staff and students

        <p className="font-semibold text-center">Academic Excellence</p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-sm">The best used of Playlab is leveraging the tool with built in implementation plans, strategies, and a way to introduce users to it in a meaningful manner and in context</p>
      </div>
    </div>

   
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Cybersecurity & Privacy">
    Schools should use Playlab in accordance with our terms of service and in a manner consistent with local, state, and federal guidelines. This includes:
    - Following COPPA and FERPA laws for K-12 students
    - Ensuring staff follow guidelines for applications that require parent/guardian permission for students under age 18
    - We recommend that there are additional guardrails and safety policies for students under the age of 13
    - Being mindful of data shared with any Playlab including Personally Identifiable Information, proprietary information, etc
    - Regularly reviewing Playlab privacy policies and data usage terms
    
    <div className="mt-4 p-4 bg-blue-50 rounded-md border border-blue-200">
      <strong>Privacy Checklist:</strong>
      <ul className="mt-2">
        <li> Review Playlab's privacy policy</li>
        <li> Obtain appropriate permissions</li>
        <li> Train staff on data protection</li>
        <li> Establish clear data handling protocols</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Ethical Use">
    Playlab AI apps pull content from various sources and don't always display the origins of that content. The lack of an author, however, doesn't mean the content can be used without attribution. Playlab should be used with:
    - Transparency about when Playlab has been used
    - Appropriate attribution of Playlab-generated content
    - Clear expectations for students about acceptable Playlab use
    - Modeling ethical Playlab usage as educators

      <div className="p-4 bg-green-50 rounded-md border border-green-200 max-w-md">
        <p className="font-semibold text-center">Sample Attribution Format</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Addressing Biases">
    Playlab AI can only learn from its source(s) and prompts, so it may perpetuate biases, misinformation, hallucinations, and problematic content from the original material. These considerations require:
    - Ensuring Playlab-generated content is always reviewed, challenged, and edited by humans
    - Teaching critical evaluation skills to students
    - Discussing Playlab limitations and biases openly with students
    - Creating opportunities to analyze and critique Playlab-generated content

## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> FAQ

<Accordion title="How can we balance Playlab use with traditional learning methods?">
  Effective Playlab integration complements rather than replaces traditional teaching. Consider using Playlab as a tool for differentiation, extension activities, or administrative tasks while preserving direct instruction, collaborative learning, and hands-on experiences. The goal should be using Playlab to enhance human connection in education, not diminish it.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What should we do if students misuse Playlab apps?">
  Address Playlab misuse as an educational opportunity rather than just a disciplinary issue. Develop clear guidelines with consequences that focus on learning proper use. Consider creating a "Playlab ethics committee" that includes student representatives to help develop and revise policies around appropriate Playlab use in educational contexts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do we ensure equitable access to Playlab?">
  Consider providing school-licensed Playlab access that all students can use regardless of home resources. Develop alternative assignments for students without reliable technology access. Provide training for parents and caregivers on supporting Playlab-integrated learning at home. Regularly assess whether Playlab implementation is creating or reducing equity gaps.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How should we handle student privacy concerns with Playlab?">
  Develop clear policies about what student information can and cannot be shared with Playlab apps. Obtain appropriate permissions before implementing Playlab systems that collect student data. Create age-appropriate educational materials to help students understand digital privacy when using Playlab. Regularly audit Playlab for compliance with privacy policies and regulations.
</Accordion>

## <Icon icon="bullhorn" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Community Engagement
