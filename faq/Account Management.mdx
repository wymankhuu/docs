## How do I get access to Playlab?

You get access by joining an [Intro to Playlab Workshop](https://calendly.com/playlab-onboarding/playlab-onboarding), or completing a [Partnership Request Form](), or by being invited by a Playlab partner.

## Can I invite other folks to join the Intro to Playlab Workshop?

Of course! Please share the link to the Intro to Playlab registration with anybody you think might benefit from learning about Playlab.

## How do I change my email address?

This depends on your situation:

**If you're changing organizations:** We recommend creating a new Playlab account and remixing any relevant apps that you have permission to keep to your new account. 

You can do this by creating a new workspace and under workspace members, adding the email you'd like associated with your new account. That'll let you create a new account with that email.

**If you're just wanting to change the email associated with your personal account:** Email [support@playlab.ai](mailto:support@playlab.ai) and they'll help you update your email address. Note: For the personal email change option, please email us from both addresses (old address and new address) so we can confirm they have access to those email addresses to confirm that you have permission to change account permissions. 


## Can I share my account with others?

No, you may not make your access credentials or account available to others outside your organization. You are responsible for all activities that occur using your credentials.

## What happens if I violate the Terms?

Playlab may suspend or terminate your access to the Services without notice for material breaches of the Term of Service.

## How does Playlab handle copyright complaints?

If you believe your intellectual property rights have been infringed, send notice to [support@playlab.ai](mailto:support@playlab.ai) with the required information. Playlab may delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers.
