## Playlab & Clever

Here's what we need to get you going with Clever on Playlab:

### 1 - Info we need to get started:
* Who should be our point contact person? Ideally this is an admin from your school, network, or district who can unblock scenarios where we pinpoint inaccuracies in your data (malformated emails, duplicate users, etc.)
* What student grades do you want to give access to Playlab.ai?
* Read through the following expectations, and let us know if anything causes concern or questions. By the end of this process:
   * Each school sync'd by the district or network will have its own organization.
   * Students and teachers will see the Playlab app via their clever dashboard.
   * Students, teachers, staff members, and district admins can sign in to Playlab with Clever.
      * Admins will have admin rights in each of these organizations.
      * Teachers and staff will have creator accounts in each of these organizations.
      * Students will have limited explorer accounts, where they can use apps but not create them.
   * For each school section, we will create a corresponding section in the organization. If we have information for which teacher runs that section, they will be given ownership over the sections in Playlab as well.

Once we hear from you we can get started

### 2 - Accept your invitation:
We will contact your point person via Clever with an invitation to sync your info with us. Through the invitation you will be able to:
* See what data we will receive
* Select which schools (if a network/district) are synced

At this stage, you should see the Playlab app on your Clever dashboard, but won't have accounts yet

### 3 - Sync and test:
Once you accept the invitation and we are notified, we will set up the sync on our end. Please account for up to **48 hours** for us to schedule and run the sync.

Once we have done so, you should be able to log in to Playlab by signing in via Clever, and should see organizations corresponding to all the schools you have shared with us. Each organization should have teachers, staff members, and students based on the information you have sync'd with us.

We will also flag any data issues we pick up on, which can be rectified at a later date.
