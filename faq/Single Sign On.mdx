## <Icon icon="key" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this feature?

Single Sign-On (SSO) allows you to access Playlab using your existing authentication credentials without creating a separate account. This streamlines the login process and helps maintain security across your educational or organizational tools.

Playlab currently supports two SSO options: Google SSO (available to everyone) and Clever SSO (available to organizational partners), making it easy to integrate into your existing workflow and classroom environment.

<Warning>
  Clever SSO is only available for Playlab organizational partners. Contact us to learn about partnership opportunities.

**Easier logins. Automatic rosters. No manual updates.**

### Why Set Up Clever Rostering?

Clever rostering creates a **seamless connection** between your district's existing student information system and Playlab. Once it's set up:

* **Instant access** – Students, teachers, and admins sign in with a single click through their Clever dashboard (no new usernames/passwords).
* **Always up to date** – Rosters update daily, so new students and staff are added automatically, and removed users are disabled without manual work.
* **Accurate permissions** – District admins, teachers, and students automatically get the right access levels.
* **No duplicate data entry** – All information flows directly from your SIS through Clever to Playlab.
* **Consistent across schools** – Each school gets its own Playlab organization with the correct sections and assigned teachers.

This means less time managing accounts and more time using Playlab for teaching, learning, and innovation.

### How Accounts Will Be Set Up

When Clever rostering is enabled:

* **Each synced school** will appear as its **own organization** in Playlab.
* **District admins** will have admin rights in each organization.
* **Teachers and staff** will have creator accounts to build and manage apps.
* **Students** will have explorer accounts (can use apps, not create them).
* **Sections in Clever** will be matched to **sections in Playlab**, and if teacher data is available, ownership of those sections will be assigned to the correct teacher.

All of this happens automatically during the initial sync and continues to update **every 24 hours.**

### How the Process Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Info We Need to Get Started">
    To begin the Clever integration process, please provide:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What schools should have access to Playlab?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>What student grades do you want to give access to Playlab?</strong></li>
    </ul>
    Once we hear from you, <strong>we will send an invitation to the district admin, scoped to the schools and grades you shared.</strong>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Accept Our Invitation to Your District">
    We will contact your Clever admin with an invitation to sync the district's info with us. Through the invitation they will be able to:
    <ul>
      <li>See what data we will receive from the district</li>
      <li>Customize what data gets shared</li>
    </ul>
    At this stage, you should see the Playlab app on your Clever dashboard, but won't have accounts yet.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Sync and Test">
    Once you accept the invitation and we are notified, we will set up the sync on our end. Please account for up to <strong>24 hours</strong> for us to schedule and run the sync.
    <br/><br/>
    Once we have done so, you should be able to log in to Playlab by signing in via Clever, and should see organizations corresponding to all the schools you have shared with us. Each organization should have teachers, staff members, and students based on the information on Clever.
    <br/><br/>
    Note that as you update information on Clever, these changes will affect Playlab within 24 hours. We run a daily sync between the data on Clever and the data on Playlab. Users may be disabled if they are no longer shared with us, but organizations will not be removed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What You'll See Once Connected

* Playlab icon in Clever for all synced users
* District admins with admin rights to all organizations
* Teachers/staff with creator accounts
* Students with explorer accounts
* Sections in Playlab matching Clever rosters (teacher ownership applied where possible)
* Daily updates for roster changes (additions, removals, section changes)
