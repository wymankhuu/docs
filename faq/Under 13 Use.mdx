## What is Playlab's position on under 13 use?

Playlab explicitly isn't ready for under 13 use. We're early in this AI wave, and most AI models aren't designed for users under 13 years of age.

## What challenges exist with AI use for under 13 users?

Issues include moderation, bias, supporting age-appropriate content, and user interface patterns. There are also more complex issues including all of the unintended implications of using this new technology with young people.

## Why is guidance needed for under 13 AI use?

Young people, including those under 13, are already experimenting with AI technologies. MIT researchers describe AI as "an arrival technology" â€“ it's accessible on devices young people and adults already use.

## What is the urgency around youth AI engagement?

There's urgency to figuring out thoughtful ways for engaging young people around AI - both so they can become critics and creators of this technology, and so they can use AI powered tools to advance teaching and learning.

## What precautions should be taken if using Playlab with under 13 students?

If you plan on using Playlab with students under 13, we suggest taking the following precautions:

1. **Third Party moderation software**: Many school devices include software that moderates what student devices use. Given the state of the technology, we recommend using this so you understand how students are using the technology and can mitigate potential risks.

2. **Rigorous testing**: Any apps you use with students should be tested and evaluated by staff first, and then in close collaboration with students before encouraging any wider adoption.

3. **Review usage**: Closely review student activity / usage of applications. We advise having students sign-in via Clever or another rostering solution.

## What is Playlab doing about these challenges?

We're working on many of the hard problems involved in making AI suitable for younger users. In the meantime, we recommend following our precautionary guidelines if you must use these technologies with students under 13.
