<Note>
ðŸ§ª This feature is currently in BETA and available to all users
</Note>

## <Icon icon="bell-on" size="24" /> What is this feature?

The Google Drive Export feature allows you to save your Playlab conversations, generated content, and artifacts directly to your Google Drive account. Whether you've created lesson plans, educational resources, student assignments, or research materials, you can now organize and store everything in your preferred cloud storage system with just a few clicks.

Think of it like having a direct pipeline from your Playlab workspace to your filing cabinet. Instead of manually copying and pasting content or taking screenshots, you can export complete conversations, or generated content with proper formatting and organization preserved.

<Warning>
This feature requires Google Drive integration and appropriate permissions to access your Google Drive account.
</Warning>

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" /> What is the Rationale for this feature?

Currently, saving Playlab content requires manually copying and pasting text, which often results in lost formatting and creates organizational overhead when managing multiple files across different systems. This manual process becomes particularly cumbersome when sharing materials with colleagues or students, requiring multiple steps and often leading to version control issues.

The Google Drive Export feature eliminates these friction points by providing an easier way to move content from Playlab to Google Drive. This integration leverages Google Drive's built-in collaboration features, making it easier to share materials while maintaining organization and version tracking.

</Steps>

## <Icon icon="star" size="24" /> Best Practices

<Accordion title="Choose the Best Export Formats">
For optimal results, use these recommended formats:

- **Google Docs**: Perfect for text-based content that you want to edit and collaborate on
- **Google Sheets**: Ideal for data, tables, and spreadsheet content
- **Google Slides**: Best for presentations and visual content
- **HTML Files**: Great for interactive tools and web-based content

These Google Workspace formats allow for seamless editing and collaboration directly in your browser.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to Access and Edit Your Exported Files">
You need to prompt your app to export to Google Drive and it will create a link to your new file. Once you click the link, you'll need to click "Open As Google Doc" (or the respective file type) to start editing the document in Google Workspace.

After opening as a Google file, you can then edit, share, and collaborate on that document just like any other Google Workspace file.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Working with HTML Exports">
If you export to HTML format, you can download the file and run it locally on your computer. This is a fun way to play with interactive tools and web-based content that you've generated in Playlab. Simply download the HTML file and open it in your web browser to see it in action.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Leverage Google Drive Sharing">
After exporting, use Google Drive's powerful sharing features:

- Share folders with your teaching team for easy collaboration
- Create view-only links for student resources
- Use comment features for collaborative review of lesson plans
- Set up shared folders for department-wide resource sharing
</Accordion>

## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" /> Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="What file formats can I export to Google Drive?">
We recommend using only these four file formats for the best experience:
- **Google Docs** for text-based content and documents
- **Google Sheets** for data, tables, and spreadsheets  
- **Google Slides** for presentations and visual content
- **HTML** for interactive tools and web-based content
These formats provide optimal functionality and editing capabilities within the Google Drive ecosystem.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I export multiple conversations at once?">
Currently, exports are done one conversation or artifact at a time. However, you can quickly export multiple items by using the export function repeatedly. Bulk export features may be added in future updates.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much Google Drive storage will my exports use?">
Storage usage varies by content type and length:
- Text-based conversations: 50-500 KB typically
- Conversations with code: 200 KB - 2 MB
- Rich content with images: 1-10 MB
- Large lesson plans or comprehensive materials: 2-20 MB

Most exports use minimal storage space relative to typical Google Drive quotas.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I disconnect Google Drive later if I change my mind?">
Yes, you can disconnect Google Drive integration at any time through your Account Settings. This will remove Playlab's access to your Google Drive, but any previously exported files will remain in your Drive. You can reconnect at any time if you want to resume using the export feature.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What permissions does Playlab need for Google Drive?">
Playlab requests permission to create and manage files in your Google Drive. This allows the app to export content and organize it in folders. Playlab cannot access existing files that it didn't create and cannot delete files from your Drive.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can Playlab read files from my Google Drive?">
No, Playlab can only write or add files to your Google Drive. It does not have permission to access or read your existing files. The integration is designed specifically for exporting content from Playlab to your Drive, not for accessing files that are already stored there.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I export content from team workspaces?">
Yes, if you have appropriate permissions within the team workspace. The ability to export depends on your role and the workspace settings configured by your administrator. Check with your workspace admin if you're unable to export content you think you should have access to.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if my Google Drive is full?">
If your Google Drive storage is full, the export will fail with an error message. You'll need to free up space in your Google Drive or upgrade your storage plan before you can successfully export content.
</Accordion>
