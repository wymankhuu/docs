## <Icon icon="bell-on" size="24" /> What is this feature?

The Optional Welcome Message feature allows Playlab builders to set a custom greeting that appears when users first interact with your app. **You can now get rid of the welcome message now as well!** 
This helps establish context, set expectations, and guide users toward the intended experience.

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" /> Rationale for the feature

You would want to do this if you want to impact the way the Playlab app starts its conversations. This is especially helpful if you have starter inputs and want to use those inputs to guide the interaction.

Instead of users starting with a blank conversation, a welcome message can introduce your app's purpose, provide instructions, or prompt users to engage with specific features right away.
