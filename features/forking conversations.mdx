## <Icon icon="bell-on" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this feature?

Forking a chat in Playlab allows you to create a new conversation branch from any specific point in an existing conversation. This means you're able to continue a conversation from a certain point while preserving the original conversation flow.

This feature is particularly useful for exploring different ideas, testing various prompts, or organizing complex discussions with the current context being kept while building and testing your apps in Playlab.

<Warning>
  You can fork a conversation only in the **builder mode** of Playlab.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Focus on specific topics">
    Zero in on a specific topic or idea without interrupting the main conversation flow, allowing for more targeted exploration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test multiple scenarios">
    Create parallel conversation branches to test different scenarios or prompts from the same starting point.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Organize complex discussions">
    Keep your thoughts and discussions organized by separating different conversation threads, especially useful for long or complex topics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preserve original context">
    Maintain the full context from your original conversation while exploring new directions without starting over.

## <Icon icon="thought-bubble" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Why would I want to fork a conversation?

### Exploring Different Scenarios

As a creator, I might want to fork a conversation to try out different things to see how different inputs impact the AI outputs.

<img height="400" src="/images/forking 1.png" className="border border-gray-300 rounded-md shadow-sm" />

* In this example, I'm generating recipes to cook for tonight with different ingredients.
* If I fork the conversation from the given point in the conversation, I can test out what type of recipes it might generate if I entered a different type of cuisine.

### Starting from a Relevant Point

Forking conversations allows me to restart my conversation from the part of the conversation that is most helpful to me without having to start from the beginning.

### Best Practices

* **More efficient testing**: Forking conversations allows more efficient testing by modifying inputs to see how they affect AI outputs.

* **Develop user scenarios**: Develop and test different user scenarios from a common starting point using forks for each persona or use case.

* **Debug AI behaviors**: Debug unexpected AI behaviors by replaying and tweaking scenarios from a forked point.

* **Comparative analysis**: Perform comparative analysis of conversational strategies by forking and comparing different approaches.

* **Enhance development efficiency**: Enhance efficiency in iterative development by avoiding redundancy and speeding up the development cycle through forking.
