## <Icon icon="bell-on" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this feature?

The Organizational References feature allows enterprise Playlab Organizations to create and manage a central collection of references that can be shared across all members and workspaces within the organization. This provides seamless access to important knowledge files, curricular materials, organizational frameworks, and anything else that might be useful throughout your entire organization.

<Note>This feature is available only to those who have enterprise Playlab Organizations.</Note>

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Rationale for the feature

Organizations often have essential knowledge bases, curricular files, and frameworks that need to be accessible across multiple teams and projects. Organizational References eliminates the need for individual uploads and ensures that all organization members have access to the most current, authoritative versions of critical materials, creating singular sources of truth across your entire organization.
