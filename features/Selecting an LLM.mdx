    <span className="font-semibold">🎉 NEW: <code className="bg-white/20 px-2 py-1 rounded text-sm">Claude Opus 4.5</code>, <code className="bg-white/20 px-2 py-1 rounded text-sm">Gemini 3 Pro</code>, and <code className="bg-white/20 px-2 py-1 rounded text-sm">ChatGPT 5.1</code> are now available in Playlab!</span>
  </div>
</div>

<Note>
**New Models Added Regularly!** We're constantly adding and updating models to give Playlabbers access to the latest AI capabilities. Our goal is to provide more open weight models and eventually open source models to give you maximum flexibility and control over your applications.
</Note>

## <Icon icon="bell-on" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this feature?

You can now build on top of even more LLMs in Playlab! There are now over 20 available AI models for you to build your Playlab apps on top of. We will try our best to always provide the latest models for you to build on top of.

<Warning>
  Changing the LLM may impact the performance of your app.
</Warning>

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Rationale for the feature

This feature allows Playlab users to experiment with and leverage the unique strengths of various AI models from different providers all within Playlab.

As you build, you might find that certain models perform better at different tasks. This will allow Playlab users to select the model that fits their needs better. The more available models, the more likely you are to find one that meets your needs. We believe that Playlabbers should have access to frontier models as we build in community.

## <Icon icon="thought-bubble" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Understanding Model Types

Before selecting a model, it's helpful to understand the different categories of AI models available:

| **Frontier Models** | **Open Weight Models** | **Open Source Models** |
|---|---|---|
| Cutting-edge, proprietary models developed by major AI companies | Models with publicly available parameters (weights) that can be downloaded and run independently | Fully open models where both weights and training code are publicly available |
| Typically offer the most advanced capabilities and are continuously updated with the latest research breakthroughs | While training code may not be available, you have more control over deployment and customization | Offer maximum transparency and customization potential |
| Examples: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude 4 models, GPT-5 series, ChatGPT 5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, Gemini models | Examples: Llama models, DeepSeek R1, GPT OSS models, Kimi K2, Qwen 3 | Coming soon! |

## <Icon icon="thought-bubble" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> How do I access these models?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the LLM selector">
    On the top left click the LLM. (By default it will be Claude Sonnet 4.5)

Selecting can be tricky. That's why we encourage you to play and experiment as you build to find the model that is best fit for your context.

### <Icon icon="scale-balanced" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Selection Considerations

<Accordion title="Ask yourself what is an ideal response time for your app?">
  This will allow you to pick larger or smaller models that meet those needs. Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude 4 Sonnet, GPT-5 Mini, and ChatGPT 5.1 offer excellent balance, while Claude Opus 4.5, Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 3 Pro, and GPT-5 prioritize quality over speed. Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-5 Nano excel at speed for simple tasks.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Identify what complexity level is your task?">
  For simple Q&A or content generation, lighter models like Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku, or GPT-5 Nano may suffice. For balanced everyday tasks, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude 4 Sonnet, GPT-5 Mini, ChatGPT 5.1, or GPT-4o are ideal. For the most complex multi-step reasoning, choose Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5, Claude 4 Opus, o3 Mini, Gemini 3 Pro, or Gemini 2.5 Pro.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the level of accuracy you are requiring of your app?">
  Critical accuracy use cases like data analysis, or HR operations might require Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5, Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 3 Pro, or other powerful models even if they're slower. Use cases that require creativity or open ended responses work well with GPT-5, GPT-5 Mini, ChatGPT 5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude 4 Sonnet, GPT-4o, or creative-focused models.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do you need open weights or source code access?">
  If you need model customization, local deployment, or transparency into model operations, consider open weight models like Llama 4 series, Qwen 3, DeepSeek R1, or GPT OSS models. For maximum performance and latest capabilities, frontier models like Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5 series, ChatGPT 5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude 4 series, GPT-4.1, Gemini 3 Pro, or Gemini 2.5 series are typically best. Consider your long-term deployment and customization needs when choosing between proprietary and open models.
</Accordion>

### <Icon icon="medal" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Best Practices

<Accordion title="Try to match your model with your use case:">
  Everyday applications: Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude 4 Sonnet, Claude Haiku 4.5, GPT-5 Mini, ChatGPT 5.1, or GPT-4o provide the best balance of performance and efficiency.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test out multiple models for apps that you are building:">
  Changing a model may change performance of an app in Playlab. Test multiple models before finalizing, as performance can vary significantly on your specific tasks. Implement A/B testing as you're building and testing to continually evaluate model performance. Consider starting with Claude Sonnet 4.5 or GPT-5 Mini as your baseline for most applications. Test both frontier and open weight models to find the best fit for your needs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Additional best practices:">
  We recommend that you remix apps as you're experimenting to not impact the original app. You can review activity to see how multiple models handle similar tasks. If you're building a suite of apps we recommend you use faster models like Claude Haiku 4.5 for simple queries and reserve powerful models like Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5, Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 3 Pro, or Gemini 2.5 Pro for complex tasks. Consider cost implications, as newer frontier models like Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, ChatGPT 5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and GPT-5 may be more expensive but offer better performance. For production apps requiring customization, evaluate open weight models like Qwen 3 alongside frontier options. Keep track of which models work best for your specific use cases to build your own selection guidelines.

Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the most balanced model, offering excellent intelligence with good speed and efficiency for most tasks. Claude Haiku 4.5 is optimized for speed and efficiency, making it ideal for quick questions and lightweight tasks.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between GPT-5, GPT-5 Mini, and GPT-5 Nano?">
  GPT-5 offers the latest breakthrough capabilities with maximum performance but slower speeds and higher costs. GPT-5 Mini provides an excellent balance of GPT-5's improvements with faster response times and better cost efficiency. GPT-5 Nano is optimized for speed and high-volume applications while maintaining core improvements over previous generations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between frontier, open weight, and open source models?">
  Frontier models are cutting-edge proprietary models with the latest capabilities but require API access. Open weight models have publicly available parameters, allowing more control and customization. Open source models provide both weights and training code. Choose based on your needs for performance vs. customization and transparency.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When should I consider open weight models like Llama 4, Qwen 3, or DeepSeek R1?">
  Consider open weight models when you need model customization, local deployment, cost control for high-volume applications, or transparency into model operations. They're also great for research and experimentation. However, frontier models typically offer better performance for most production applications.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I decide between GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1 Nano?">
  Choose GPT-4.1 for complex technical tasks requiring maximum capability. Choose GPT-4.1 Nano for applications where speed and cost are more important than peak performance, especially for high-volume or simpler tasks.
