## What is this feature? <Icon name="new-box" />

This is a toggle in settings that Playlab builders can turn on to prevent AI from completing work directly for the user.

<Warning>
  Once enabled, users cannot toggle this feature off. Only creators can decide to turn it on or off.
</Warning>

## Rationale for the feature <Icon name="chat-question" />

There are times when providing answers or direct outputs is appropriate, but there are often times when the builder does not want the user to have direct access to the final answer or completed output. In the cases where you don't want the answer generated, you can toggle the Avoid Answer Generation setting as you're building.

## See it in action <Icon name="clipboard-question" />

Here is a sample writing feedback app where the builder does not want the app to be able to do any writing for the student and only to provide feedback on what the student provides themselves and also offer guiding questions to improve writing. The other thing to note is that the sample app does not have explicit prompting instructions to avoid providing final writing generation.
