The Submit Your App Community feature allows Playlab builders to share their publicly published Playlab app for consideration to be featured in the Playlab community. This gives you an opportunity to showcase your work and share it with other Playlab users. You can explore featured community apps in our [Playlab Community](https://playlab.ai/explore).
