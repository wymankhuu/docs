  **Preview Required**
  
  You must preview your app to test how starter inputs work! To effectively implement starter inputs, you should:
  - Test your inputs in preview mode
  - Ensure they collect the right information
  - Check that required fields appear as intended
</Warning>

When adding starter inputs to your Playlab app, keep these tips in mind:

  - **Keep it focused** - Only ask for information that's essential for your app's function
  - **Use appropriate input types** for different kinds of information:
    - Short text for names, simple responses
    - Long text for detailed feedback or descriptions
    - Dropdowns for single-choice categorized data or limited options
    - Checkboxes for multi-choice selections where users might choose multiple relevant options
    - File uploads when documents or images are needed
  - **Make labels clear and specific** so users understand exactly what information to provide
  - **Use placeholder text** to provide examples or clarification
  - **Consider the user journey** - arrange inputs in a logical sequence
  - **Balance required vs. optional fields** - too many required fields can be overwhelming
  - **Test with different inputs** to ensure your app handles all responses appropriately
  - **Preview before publishing** to experience your app from the user's perspective

<Accordion title="What types of starter inputs can I add to my app?">
  Playlab currently supports five types of starter inputs:
  
  - **Short Text:** Ideal for brief responses like names, single words, or short phrases
  - **Long Text:** Perfect for extended responses, descriptions, feedback, or essays
  - **Dropdown:** Allows users to select a single option from predefined choices, ensuring structured responses
  - **Checkbox:** Enables users to select multiple options from predefined choices, perfect for collecting multiple preferences or categories
  - **File Upload:** Enables users to upload files (up to 5MB) such as images, PDFs, or CSVs
  
  Each type serves different purposes, so choose based on the kind of information you need to collect.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many starter inputs should I include in my app?">
  While there's no strict limit, we recommend keeping the number of inputs focused and relevant to your app's purpose. Too many inputs might overwhelm users and create friction. Consider what information is absolutely necessary for your app to function effectively.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I make changes to starter inputs after publishing my app?">
  Yes, you can modify starter inputs even after publishing your app. However, be aware that:
  
  - Removing inputs that existing users have relied on might create confusion
  - Adding new required inputs might break the experience for returning users
  
  Consider creating a new version of your app for significant changes to starter inputs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I use the information collected from starter inputs?">
  The information users provide through starter inputs becomes available in your app's context. You can:
  
  - Reference specific inputs in your app's instructions and prompts
  - Use the information to customize the conversation flow
  - Process uploaded files to extract relevant data
  - Handle multiple selections from checkbox inputs to personalize responses
  
  Make sure your app effectively utilizes this information to provide value to users.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are starter inputs visible to all users of my app?">
  Yes, all users who access your app will see the starter inputs you've configured. If you have inputs that should only be visible to certain users, consider creating separate versions of your app for different audiences.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if a user skips an optional starter input?">
  If a starter input is marked as optional and a user doesn't provide information, your app will proceed without that data. Make sure your app's logic can handle missing optional inputs gracefully.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use uploaded files in my app's functionality?">
  Yes, files uploaded through starter inputs can be processed within your app. This is particularly useful for:
  
  - Analyzing data from CSV files
  - Extracting text from PDFs
  - Using images as reference material
  
  Ensure your app includes appropriate instructions for handling uploaded files.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When should I use dropdown vs. checkbox inputs?">
  Choose based on how many selections you want users to make:
  
  **Dropdown inputs** are best when:
  - Users should select only one option
  - You want to ensure mutually exclusive choices
  - You have a limited set of predefined options
  
  **Checkbox inputs** are ideal when:
  - Users might want to select multiple relevant options
  - Choices aren't mutually exclusive
  - You want to gather comprehensive preferences or multiple categories
  
  Both ensure consistent, predictable responses and prevent typos compared to free-text inputs.
