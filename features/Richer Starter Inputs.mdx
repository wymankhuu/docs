## <Icon icon="bell-on" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this feature?

Playlab now supports Richer Starter Inputs, allowing builders to add diverse input types when creating apps. You can now include short text, long text, dropdown selections, and file uploads (up to 5MB), giving your users more flexibility in how they interact with your apps.

<Warning>
  When using dropdown inputs, you must include at least two options for users to select from.
</Warning>

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Rationale for the feature

Previously, Playlab users were limited in how they could structure inputs. With Richer Starter Inputs, builders can tailor input types to fit specific use cases, enhancing the overall user experience.

Whether you need structured responses via dropdowns, open-ended text input, or an upload file to help you get your interaction started, this update makes it easier to collect and leverage the required data to get you started.

### Best Practices

<Accordion title="Combine multiple input types">
  Create a seamless user experience by combining different input types (e.g., name as short text + description as long text).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use dropdowns strategically">
  When responses should be structured and predictable, dropdowns help maintain consistency.
</Accordion>

  Always preview your app before publishing to ensure a good user experience. Ask yourself what should be required and what you want to happen during conversation.
