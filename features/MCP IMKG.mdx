## Overview

<Note>
ðŸ§ª This feature is currently in BETA and available to all users
</Note>

The Illustrative Mathematics Knowledge Graph Tool transforms your Playlab apps by providing direct access to a comprehensive database of curriculum content, educational standards, lesson materials, and instructional resources from Illustrative Mathematics. Rather than relying on generic AI responses about math concepts, your app can now query specific, curriculum-aligned content that understands how every mathematical concept connects within the IM framework.

<Warning>
Enabling this tool will modify your app's behavior to prioritize specific IM curriculum queries over general mathematical responses.
</Warning>

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Your App Prompt">
    Add these instructions to your Playlab app prompt for optimal performance:

    ```text
    You have access to the IM knowledge graph tool for curriculum-specific queries. 
    When users ask about mathematical concepts, teaching strategies, or curriculum 
    content, prioritize IM Knowledge Graph results over general knowledge. You can 
    display relevant images from IM materials using markdown format to enhance 
    explanations with visual content.
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Different Query Types">
    Validate the tool works correctly by testing various query categories:
    
    **Concept Queries:** "How does IM approach teaching fractions in grade 3?"
    
    **Resource Requests:** "Find IM activities for area and perimeter introduction"
    
    **Standards Alignment:** "What standards does IM Grade 5 Unit 4 cover?"
    
    **Learning Progressions:** "How does IM sequence ratio and proportion concepts?"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Optimize Integration">
    Refine your app instructions based on testing results to maximize the tool's effectiveness for your specific use case.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Knowledge Graphs in Education

### What Makes This Different

A curriculum knowledge graph goes beyond simple content storage. It maps the relationships between educational concepts, learning objectives, and teaching strategies in ways that mirror how students actually learn and how expert educators design instruction.

### The IM360 Advantage

This knowledge graph captures the pedagogical reasoning behind Illustrative Mathematics curriculum design. It understands:

* **Sequential Logic:** Why concepts appear in specific order
* **Conceptual Connections:** How mathematical ideas build upon each other
* **Teaching Strategies:** Specific IM approaches to common misconceptions
* **Assessment Integration:** How formative and summative assessments align
