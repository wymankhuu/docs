## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Rationale for the feature

This feature allows Playlab users to create personalized experiences with AI applications by providing context about themselves, their preferences, and their goals. User profiles help the AI understand who you are and tailor responses accordingly.

By defining your preferences, background, and needs upfront, you can receive more relevant and customized responses from Playlab apps without having to repeatedly explain your context in each interaction.

  Your interests, goals, and preferences may change over time. Remember to update your profile to ensure AI responses remain relevant to your current needs.
