description: "Listen to Playlab responses with text-to-speech audio playback"
---

<Note>
  🧪 This feature is currently in BETA and is available to all Playlab users.
</Note>

## <Icon icon="bell-on" size="24" /> What is this feature?
Reading text on screens can be tiring, especially during long sessions. Voice Output provides text-to-speech playback directly in Playlab, letting you listen to responses while multitasking, taking notes, or resting your eyes. This makes Playlab more accessible and flexible, supporting different learning preferences and enabling hands-free interaction.

<Info>
  Voice Output uses your device's native text-to-speech capabilities, which means all audio is generated locally on your device with complete privacy. Voice quality may vary depending on your operating system and available voices.

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" /> What is the Rationale for this feature?

Reading text on screens can be tiring, especially during long sessions or when working through complex information. Many people absorb information better through listening, and audio output enables hands-free interaction with AI. This creates opportunities for multitasking, accessibility for users with visual impairments or reading difficulties, and a more natural conversational experience.

The Voice Output feature eliminates the need to read every response by providing text-to-speech playback directly in Playlab. Instead of being tied to your screen, you can listen to Playlab's responses while taking notes, working on other tasks, or simply resting your eyes. The system provides audio with controls that give you complete control over how you consume information. This makes it easier to work with Playlab in a more flexible, accessible way that adapts to your needs and preferences.

## <Icon icon="star" size="24" /> Best Practices

<Accordion title="Use Headphones in Shared Spaces">
  For the best experience and to avoid disturbing others, consider using headphones when using voice output in shared workspaces, classrooms, or public environments. This also provides better audio quality and helps you focus on the content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Follow Along Visually When Learning">
  For educational content or when learning new concepts, consider following along with the text while listening. This helps reinforce understanding through both visual and auditory channels.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Voice Output for Long Responses">
  Voice output is particularly valuable for lengthy responses where reading might be fatiguing. This allows you to absorb detailed information while remaining comfortable and potentially multitasking.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Combine with Voice Input for Full Voice Experience">
  When used together with voice input, you can create a fully conversational voice experience with Playlab. Speak your questions and listen to responses for a hands-free interaction that feels natural and intuitive.
</Accordion>

## <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" size="24" /> Known Issues

As this feature is currently in beta, there are a few known limitations to be aware of:

<Accordion title="Playback May Lag on Very Long Responses">
  **Issue**: For extremely long responses (several paragraphs or more), there may be a brief delay before audio playback begins as the system processes the text.

  **Workaround**: The delay is typically only a few seconds. You can start reading the text while waiting for audio to begin, and playback will start automatically once processing is complete.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Code Blocks May Sound Unnatural">
  **Issue**: When responses contain code snippets or technical formatting, the text-to-speech may pronounce elements in ways that sound awkward or are difficult to follow audibly.

  **Workaround**: For code-heavy responses, consider reading the text visually while using voice output for surrounding explanatory text. You can also pause playback during code sections.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Mathematical Notation Limitations">
  **Issue**: Complex mathematical equations or special notation may not be read in the most intuitive way by the text-to-speech system.

  **Workaround**: For responses with heavy mathematical content, visual reading is recommended. Voice output works best for conceptual explanations and general text.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Voice Quality Variation">
  **Issue**: Voice quality depends on your device's operating system and installed text-to-speech voices. Some devices may have more limited or less natural-sounding voices than others.

  **Note**: The voices available in Playlab depend on your device's capabilities. Modern devices typically offer good quality voices.
</Accordion>

## <Icon icon="shield-check" size="24" /> Privacy & Security

Your privacy and security are our top priority. Here's what you should know about voice output:

- **Local Processing**: Voice output uses your device's native text-to-speech capabilities. All audio generation happens locally on your device, meaning no voice data is transmitted to external servers.
- **Complete Privacy**: Because processing is local, your data never leaves your device during voice output. This ensures complete privacy for all content you choose to hear.
- **No Data Storage**: No audio files are generated or stored. The text-to-speech happens in real-time using your device's built-in features.
- **Under 13 Use**: We recommend disabling this feature if your organization has students under age 13 using Playlab.
- **Control**: You have complete control over when audio plays. Voice output only activates when you explicitly click the speaker icon.
- **Device Dependent**: Voice quality and available voices depend on your device's operating system and installed accessibility features.
