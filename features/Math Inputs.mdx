## <Icon icon="bell-on" size="24" /> What is this feature?

The Math Inputs feature allows you to insert properly formatted mathematical equations and notation directly into your Playlab conversations. Whether you're working with algebraic expressions, calculus problems, trigonometric functions, or matrices, you can now input complex mathematical notation using a convenient equation editor with just a few clicks.

Think of it like having a built-in mathematical keyboard at your fingertips. Instead of trying to type out equations using plain text or worrying about how to represent mathematical symbols, you can use the interface to build equations with proper formatting and notation that Playlab can understand and work with. Behind the scenes, the editor converts your visual input into LaTeX mathematical notation, which is then rendered using KaTeX for high quality display.

<Warning>
Math inputs require the equation editor interface to ensure proper formatting and interpretation of mathematical notation.
</Warning>

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" /> What is the Rationale for this feature?

Currently, entering mathematical notation in plain text can be cumbersome and prone to errors. Trying to communicate complex equations using only keyboard characters often results in ambiguous or unclear expressions that are difficult for both AI and humans to interpret correctly. This creates friction when working on mathematical problems, teaching math concepts, or generating math-related educational content.

The Math Inputs feature is a step towards eliminating these challenges by providing a dedicated equation editor that ensures mathematical expressions are properly formatted and unambiguous. The visual editor converts your button clicks and selections into LaTeX notation (the gold standard for mathematical typesetting), and then displays the result using KaTeX, a fast rendering library that produces crisp, professional mathematical notation. This two-step process makes it easier to work with mathematical content in Playlab while maintaining precision and clarity in your mathematical communication.

## <Icon icon="star" size="24" /> Best Practices

<Accordion title="Choose the Right Function Categories">
The equation editor organizes functions into categories for easy access:

- **Functions**: Basic trigonometric and logarithmic functions (sin, cos, tan, sec, arcsin, arctan, log, ln)
- **Algebra**: Algebraic operations and expressions (cos, cot, sinh, cosh)
- **Calculus**: Calculus-specific notation (tan, arcsin, cosh, tanh)
- **Matrices**: Matrix operations and absolute value (csc, arccos, tanh, |x|)

Select the appropriate category to quickly find the functions you need.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use the Preview Feature">
Always check the Preview section before inserting your equation. This ensures that your mathematical notation appears exactly as you intended and helps catch any formatting issues before you send your message.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Combine with Text for Context">
While the math input creates properly formatted equations, remember to include explanatory text in your message to provide context. For example: "Solve this equation for x:" followed by your inserted equation, or "What is the derivative of" followed by your function notation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Start Simple, Build Complex">
For complex equations, start by entering the basic structure and then add more sophisticated elements. The equation editor makes it easy to build up complicated expressions step by step rather than trying to enter everything at once.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Leverage for Teaching and Learning">
Math inputs are particularly powerful for:
- Creating practice problems with proper notation
- Demonstrating step-by-step solutions
- Generating worksheets with correctly formatted equations
- Explaining mathematical concepts with precise notation
</Accordion>

## <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" size="24" /> Known Issues

As this feature is currently in beta, there are a few known limitations to be aware of:

<Accordion title="Multiple Equations in One Message">
**Issue**: Do not try to insert more than one equation at a time in the same message. While multiple equations may look correct in the text input field, they will not display with proper formatting in the chat.

**Workaround**: Insert a new line using **Shift + Enter** after each equation before inserting the next one. This will ensure each equation renders correctly in the chat display.

Example:
- Insert first equation
- Press Shift + Enter to create a new line
- Insert second equation
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keyboard Deletion Issues">
**Issue**: If you delete characters using your keyboard (backspace or delete keys) while editing an equation in the text input field, the equation may not parse correctly and will display an error.

**Workaround**: If you need to modify an equation after inserting it:
- Clear the entire equation from the text input
- Click the calculator icon to open the equation editor again
- Rebuild the equation from scratch using the editor interface

Avoid using keyboard deletion on inserted equations to prevent parsing errors.
</Accordion>

## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" /> Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="How does the equation formatting work?">
The math input editor uses a two-step process to convert your visual equation building into beautifully formatted mathematical notation:

1. **LaTeX Conversion**: As you click buttons and build your equation in the editor, your input is automatically converted into LaTeX markup. LaTeX is the standard mathematical typesetting language used in academic and scientific publishing. For example, when you click "sin" and then "x", the editor generates the LaTeX code `\sin(x)`.

2. **KaTeX Rendering**: Once the LaTeX notation is generated, it's rendered using KaTeX, a fast and lightweight mathematical rendering library. KaTeX takes the LaTeX code and transforms it into crisp, professional-quality mathematical notation that displays perfectly in your browser.

This means you get the precision of LaTeX and the beautiful rendering of KaTeX without needing to write any code yourself. The entire process happens automatically behind the scenes.
