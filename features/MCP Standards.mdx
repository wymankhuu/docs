title: "ðŸ†• State Standards Knowledge Graph Tool in Playlab"
description: "Access comprehensive state educational standards through AI-powered knowledge graph queries including Common Core, NGSS, and WIDA"
---

## Overview

<Note>
ðŸ§ª This feature is currently in BETA and available to all users
</Note>

The State Standards Knowledge Graph Tool transforms your Playlab apps by providing direct access to a comprehensive database of educational standards including Common Core State Standards (CCSS), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), and WIDA English Language Development standards. Rather than relying on generic AI responses about educational standards, your app can now query specific, standards-aligned content that understands how every standard connects within state frameworks.

<Warning>
Enabling this tool will modify your app's behavior to prioritize specific state standards queries over general educational responses.
</Warning>

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Your App Prompt">
    Add these instructions to your Playlab app prompt for optimal performance:

    ```text
You have access to the State Standards knowledge graph tool for curriculum-specific queries. When users ask about educational standards, alignment requirements, or standards-based content, prioritize State Standards results over general knowledge. 
You can reference specific standards codes and alignment information to enhance explanations with accurate standards-based content.
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Different Query Types">
    Validate the tool works correctly by testing various query categories:
    
    **Standards Queries:** "Find Common Core math standards for 4th grade fractions"
    
    **Science Standards:** "What NGSS standards cover ecosystems in middle school?"
    
    **Language Standards:** "WIDA standards for academic writing proficiency"
    
    **Cross-Standards Alignment:** "How do Common Core and NGSS align in elementary grades?"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Optimize Integration">
    Refine your app instructions based on testing results to maximize the tool's effectiveness for your specific use case.
  </Step>

## Understanding Standards Knowledge Graphs

### What Makes This Different

A standards knowledge graph goes beyond simple content storage. It maps the relationships between educational standards, learning objectives, and assessment criteria in ways that mirror how educators design curriculum and instruction.

### The Standards Advantage

This knowledge graph captures the interconnected nature of educational standards across subjects and grade levels. It understands:

* **Vertical Alignment:** How standards progress from grade to grade
* **Cross-Curricular Connections:** How standards connect across subject areas
* **Assessment Alignment:** How standards align with state assessments
* **Implementation Guidance:** Best practices for standards implementation

  <Accordion title="Which AI models work best with this tool?">
    For optimal performance with the State Standards Knowledge Graph Tool:
    
    **Tier 1 Performance (Recommended):** Claude 4 Sonnet (excellent balance of speed, accuracy, and standards analysis), GPT-4.1 (superior for complex standards alignment and detailed responses), and Gemini 2.5 Pro (high accuracy with comprehensive educational standards analysis).
    
    **Tier 2 Performance:** Claude 4 Opus (most thorough standards analysis but slower response times), Claude 3 Opus (strong standards interpretation with good reasoning), and Kimi K2 (advanced tool usage with solid educational standards handling).
    
    **Speed-Optimized Options:** Claude 3.5 Haiku (faster responses with reduced analysis depth) and GPT-4.1 Nano (quick queries for simple standards questions).
    
    For most educational applications, Claude 4 Sonnet or GPT-4.1 provide the optimal balance of capability and efficiency for standards-based queries.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I find connections between different standards frameworks?">
    Yes! The knowledge graph excels at revealing cross-curricular connections, such as how Common Core mathematics standards align with NGSS science practices, or how WIDA language standards support content area learning.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about state-specific adaptations of these standards?">
    While the tool focuses on the core national frameworks, it includes information about common state adaptations and implementation variations. You can supplement with state-specific resources through Playlab's reference system.
