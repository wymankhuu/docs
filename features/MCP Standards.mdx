## <Icon icon="brain" size="24" /> Understanding Standards Knowledge Graphs

### What Makes This Different

A standards knowledge graph goes beyond simple content storage. It maps the relationships between educational standards, learning objectives, and assessment criteria in ways that mirror how educators design curriculum and instruction.

### The Standards Advantage

This knowledge graph captures the interconnected nature of educational standards across subjects and grade levels. It understands:

- **Vertical Alignment:** How standards progress from grade to grade
- **Cross-Curricular Connections:** How standards connect across subject areas
- **Assessment Alignment:** How standards align with state assessments
- **Implementation Guidance:** Best practices for standards implementation

### <Icon icon="map" size="24" /> State Subject Areas

The tool provides access to standards across four core educational areas:
- **English Language Arts**
- **Mathematics**  
- **Science**
- **Social Studies**

<Note>
For each State-Subject pair, there is a dedicated "document" that contains the standards information. In some cases, like Pennsylvania Social Studies, there are several documents within a single state-subject combination.
</Note>

## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" /> Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="Which state standards are included in the knowledge graph?">
The knowledge graph includes standards for English, Math, Science, and Social Studies across participating states, plus national frameworks including Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and ELA, Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), WIDA English Language Development standards, and WIDA Spanish Language Development Standards (Marco DALE). Note that some state-subject combinations are temporarily missing from the current database.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the current system limitations and known issues?">
The tool is currently in BETA with some known performance characteristics:

**Tool Call Reliability:** You may notice the tool requires multiple calls to find the correct information due to formatting inconsistencies across states. An update to the knowledge graph is expected in the next few months that will improve tool call dependability.

**Inconsistent Formatting:** One of the biggest limitations is inconsistent formatting from one state-subject to another. For example, the tool may attempt to filter by grade level, which won't work for some documents that organize grades differently because:
- Grade level attributes might not exist in some documents
- Grades might be written as "middle school" or "grades 3-5" rather than the expected list format (e.g., [7,8,9])
- Different states use varying organizational schemes for the same content areas

**West Virginia Mislabeling:** West Virginia standards documents are incorrectly listed with `state="Virginia"` in the system. The tool can usually recognize and correct this error automatically, but you may see Virginia results when searching for West Virginia standards.

**Varied Organizational Schemes:** Different states organize their standards using different structural approaches. Some documents use domains/clusters organization while others employ different hierarchical structures, causing inconsistent knowledge graph traversal when moving between state-subject combinations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How current are the standards in the database?">
