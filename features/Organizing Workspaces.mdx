description: 'Categorize your apps by development status to better organize your Playlab workspaces'

## <Icon icon="bell-on" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this feature?

Help organizations better organize and distinguish between apps in their Playlab workspaces based on development status. This feature allows you to categorize your apps by different status designations to clearly indicate their stage in the development lifecycle.

<Warning>
  Only administrators, workspace owners, and app creators can designate app status.
</Warning>

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Rationale for the feature

Users looking at a workspace full of apps don't have a clear idea of which apps are complete and ready to be used and which are half baked or still in progress. This feature provides visual cues and filtering capabilities to help teams better understand the status of each app in their workspace.

As you build more apps, organization becomes essential. This feature helps you manage your growing collection of Playlab apps by clearly identifying their current development stage.

### Workspace before organizing by status:

My team and I have built a bunch of Playlab apps. It's getting hard to figure out the status of each of our apps.

<img height="800" src="/images/organizingworkspaces1.jpeg" className="border border-gray-300 rounded-md shadow-sm" />

* As a **user** I don't know which apps are ready to use and which ones are finished, just started, or need additional support.
* As a **creator** I'm having a hard time keeping track of which apps I'm playing with and which apps I want to test.
* As an **administrator** I'm having a hard time figuring out what to review, and what to share out with others as a finished product.

### Workspace after organizing by status:

My team and I have built a bunch of Playlab apps. We are going to use this feature to help sort our apps into appropriate statuses.

<img height="800" src="/images/organizingworkspaces2.jpeg" className="border border-gray-300 rounded-md shadow-sm" />

* As a **user** I now know that apps marked Ready to use are good to go.
* As a **creator** I can clearly identify which apps are in Play status and which Experiment apps need to be tested more.
* As an **administrator** I can see which apps are being experimented with, what people are playing with, and what apps I need to review.

### Best Practices

<Accordion title="Remember status defaults">
  All apps default to **Playing** when first created or remixed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Status is fluid">
  Statuses are fluid. You can change the status of an app at any time as it progresses through development.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Legacy apps">
  Apps made before this release will not have any accompanying status.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Publishing considerations">
  Publish apps that you are **Experimenting** with or **In Review** with folks who you want to have access to. Don't publish to the public if it's not **Ready to use**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Version management">
  If you've tested many versions of the same app and ultimately decide one is the best one, you might want to **archive** versions you do not intend on using.
</Accordion>
