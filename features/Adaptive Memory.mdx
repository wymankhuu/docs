title: 'Adaptive Memory'
description: 'Enable your Playlab applications to selectively remember important information'
---

## <Icon icon="bell-on" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this feature?

Adaptive memory allows your Playlab apps to selectively remember things you instruct it to remember, impacting future interactions users have with your app.

<Warning>
  Using adaptive memory will change the way your app functions as it will include what it remembers into the chat.
</Warning>

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Rationale for the feature

This feature enhances the capabilities of your Playlab apps in several key ways:

* **More Natural Conversations:** AI will maintain context and have more coherent discussions
* **Better Understanding:** Enables AI to grasp nuanced meanings and references from earlier in the conversation
* **Improved Assistance:** Allows AI to build upon previous responses and refine its help based on user feedback
* **Context Awareness:** Helps AI understand when previous information needs to be updated or modified

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Tips for Creating Effective Memory Instructions

### Best Practices

<Accordion title="Be specific about what to remember">
  Clearly define the categories of information your app should retain. Vague instructions may result in remembering too much irrelevant information or missing important details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Prioritize information by importance">
  Not all information needs to be remembered. Focus on the details that will have the most significant impact on future interactions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Regularly review and refine">
  As your app evolves, revisit your memory instructions to ensure they're still capturing the most relevant information for your users.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test with real conversations">
  Analyze how memory affects actual user interactions and adjust your instructions based on what works best in practice.
</Accordion>

### Practical Applications

<Accordion title="Educational Apps">
  Remember learning progress, difficult concepts, and preferred explanatory styles to provide increasingly tailored educational content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Productivity Tools">
  Track project stages, recurring tasks, and work preferences to offer more relevant assistance over time.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Creative Assistants">
  Remember stylistic preferences, past projects, and creative goals to provide more consistent and helpful creative guidance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Health and Wellness Apps">
  Track progress, habits, challenges, and preferences to provide more personalized support and recommendations.
</Accordion>

## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> FAQ

<Accordion title="How does adaptive memory differ from user profiles?">
  While user profiles provide static information set up in advance, adaptive memory dynamically captures and retains information that emerges during conversations. Both features can complement each other for a more personalized experience.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I control what information is remembered?">
  Yes, your memory instructions guide what the AI remembers. You can also view, refresh, or delete stored memories in the management panel.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much information can be remembered?">
  There are limits to how much information can be stored in memory. Focus on quality over quantity by instructing the AI to remember only the most impactful details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is memory information private?">
  Memory information is stored as part of your app's data. For specific privacy concerns, please refer to our privacy policy or contact support.
</Accordion>

## <Icon icon="warning" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Important Considerations

<Warning>
  Be cautious about including Personally Identifying information in your memory instructions. Avoid instructing the AI to remember last names, addresses, contact information, and other sensitive information that you would not be comfortable sharing.
</Warning>
