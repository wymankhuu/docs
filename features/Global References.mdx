## <Icon icon="bell-on" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this feature?

The Workspace Reference Library allows you to create and manage a central collection of references that can be shared across multiple apps in your workspace, eliminating the need to upload the same references for each app individually.

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Rationale for the feature

When building multiple Playlab apps, you often need to use the same reference materials across different apps. The Workspace Reference Library streamlines this process by allowing you to manage a central collection of references that can be easily attached to any app in your workspace, saving time and ensuring consistency across your projects.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many references can you add to your workspace library?">
  You can add as many references as you need to your workspace reference library. However, for optimal performance, we recommend being selective about which references you attach to each individual app.
