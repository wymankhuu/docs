## <Icon icon="bell-on" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this feature?

Remixing Multiple Apps lets you select and remix up to 10 Playlab apps into your workspace simultaneously. Instead of remixing apps one at a time, you can now batch select multiple apps and bring them all into your workspace in a single action.

This feature streamlines your workflow when you want to experiment with, compare, or build upon multiple existing apps at once.

<Warning>
There is a limit of 10 apps that can be remixed at once. This ensures optimal performance and prevents workspace clutter.
</Warning>

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Rationale for the feature

By enabling batch remixing of multiple apps, we can significantly speed up your creative and development workflow. This approach is perfect for users who want to compare different app approaches, merge concepts from multiple sources, or quickly populate their workspace with related apps for experimentationâ€”eliminating the tedious process of individual app remixing while maintaining organized workspace management.
