<Note>**Beta Feature** - Knowledge Graph Tools are now available to all Playlab users!</Note>

## <Icon icon="diagram-project" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What are Knowledge Graph Tools?

Knowledge Graph Tools give your Playlab apps access to specialized educational databases and organizational content and improve the accuracy and reliability of your Playlab apps. Instead of searching for a few snippets at a time, these tools can navigate through entire content collections, following the structure and connections between topics until they find exactly what's needed.

### How Knowledge Graphs Work

Think of a knowledge graph like a well-organized filing system. Just as you might organize teaching materials into folders by subject, grade level, and unit, knowledge graphs understand and maintain the natural structure of educational content.

When your app needs information, the tool can:
- Navigate through the content hierarchy (like opening folders)
- Follow connections between related topics
- Search multiple times until it finds the complete information needed
- Pull from different sections or documents to build a comprehensive response

This is different from traditional search, which might only find a few isolated snippets without understanding how they connect or where to look next.
