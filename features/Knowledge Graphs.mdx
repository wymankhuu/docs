## <Icon icon="diagram-project" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What are Knowledge Graph Tools?

Knowledge Graph Tools give your Playlab apps access to specialized educational databases and organizational content and improve the accuracy and reliability of your Playlab apps. Instead of searching for a few snippets at a time, these tools can navigate through entire content collections, following the structure and connections between topics until they find exactly what's needed.

### How Knowledge Graphs Work

Think of a knowledge graph like a well-organized filing system. Just as you might organize teaching materials into folders by subject, grade level, and unit, knowledge graphs understand and maintain the natural structure of educational content.

When your app needs information, the tool can:
- Navigate through the content hierarchy (like opening folders)
- Follow connections between related topics
- Search multiple times until it finds the complete information needed
- Pull from different sections or documents to build a comprehensive response

This is different from traditional search, which might only find a few isolated snippets without understanding how they connect or where to look next.

## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> FAQ

<Accordion title="How are Knowledge Graph Tools different from regular references?">
  Regular references find the 10 most similar snippets and stop. 
  
  Knowledge Graph Tools can search multiple times, understand how documents are organized, and keep looking until they find exactly what's needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use multiple Knowledge Graph Tools in one app?">
  Yes! You can enable multiple knowledge graph tools together. For example, an app could access both Illustrative Mathematics and your organizational content simultaneously.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much content can an Organizational Knowledge Graph handle?">
  These are designed to scale. They can handle hundreds of documents totaling thousands of pages while maintaining fast, accurate search. For example the IM knowledge graph tool includes all of IM.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my organization has copyrighted materials?">
  You can include materials you've paid for, provided access is limited to authorized users and you have rights to use content this way. We cannot process content behind individual authentication paywalls.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long does it take to build an Organizational Knowledge Graph?">
  Processing time depends on the amount of content. Contact partnerships@playlab.ai for specific timelines based on your needs.
