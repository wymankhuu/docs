## <Icon icon="bell-on" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this feature?

Playlab offers two types of exports to help Enterprise Organizations track and understand platform usage: **Activity Exports** and **Org Analytics Exports**. These exports provide detailed insights into user interactions, app usage, and organizational trends across your workspace.

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Rationale for the feature

Enterprise Organizations need comprehensive data insights to understand how their teams are using Playlab, track engagement patterns, and make informed decisions about AI tool adoption. The data export features provide detailed analytics and activity logs that help administrators monitor usage, identify trends, and optimize their Playlab deployment.

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Tips for Using Data Exports

- **Plan your date ranges**: Activity exports are limited to 31-day periods, so plan multiple exports for longer time ranges.
- **Use filters strategically**: Apply user and app filters to focus on specific teams or projects.
- **Regular monitoring**: Set up regular export schedules to track trends over time.
- **Data analysis**: Use the CSV format from Org Analytics for easy analysis in spreadsheet applications.
- **Privacy considerations**: Ensure exported data is handled according to your organization's data privacy policies.
