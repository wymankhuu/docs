## What is this feature?

Individual App Activity Review allows you to dive deep into the usage analytics and performance metrics of a specific Playlab app. Unlike workspace activity review which shows usage across all your apps, this feature provides focused insights into how users interact with a particular app, including conversation patterns, feature usage, and engagement metrics.

Think of it as having a microscope for your app's performance. While workspace activity gives you the big picture across all your apps, individual app activity lets you examine the details of how one specific app is performing and being used by your audience.

<Warning>
  This feature requires creator or admin permissions for the specific app you want to review.
</Warning>

## What is the Rationale for this feature?

While workspace activity review helps you understand overall usage patterns across all your apps, creators often need granular insights into how individual apps are performing. Without app-specific analytics, it's difficult to identify which features within an app are most valuable, where users get stuck, or how to optimize the app's content and functionality.

Individual App Activity Review fills this gap by providing focused analytics that help creators understand user behavior within a specific app, identify optimization opportunities, and make targeted improvements to enhance the app's effectiveness and user experience.

## Individual App Analysis Best Practices

Consider these recommendations when analyzing individual app activity:

- **Compare performance over time** to identify trends and measure improvements
- **Focus on conversation quality metrics** like message depth and completion rates
- **Identify your app's "power users"** to understand what drives engagement
- **Look for common user pathways** to optimize the most popular workflows
- **Monitor feature adoption rates** for new functionality you've added
- **Track seasonal patterns** specific to your app's subject matter or use case
- **Analyze drop-off points** to identify where users lose interest or encounter problems

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Optimizing Based on Usage Patterns">
  Use individual app data to make targeted improvements:

  - **High-engagement features**: Double down on what's working by expanding similar functionality
  - **Low-engagement areas**: Redesign or remove parts of your workflow that aren't being used
  - **Common user paths**: Streamline and optimize the most popular workflows
  - **Drop-off points**: Add guidance, simplify processes, or provide more direct workflow steps

  Focus your development efforts on changes that will have the greatest impact on user experience.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Comparing Individual Apps">
  When you manage multiple apps, use individual app analytics to:

  - **Benchmark performance** across your app portfolio
  - **Identify successful patterns** to replicate in other apps
  - **Allocate resources** to your highest-performing or highest-potential apps
  - **Learn from outliers** both positive and negative performance cases

  This comparative analysis helps you apply lessons learned across your entire app ecosystem.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="User Feedback Integration">
  Combine activity data with qualitative feedback:

  - **Correlate usage patterns** with user comments and ratings
  - **Identify disconnect points** where high usage doesn't match user satisfaction
  - **Prioritize improvements** based on both data and user requests
  - **Validate assumptions** about how users want to interact with your app

  Quantitative activity data becomes more powerful when combined with qualitative user feedback.
</Accordion>
