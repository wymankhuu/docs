## <Icon icon="bell-on" size="24" /> What is this feature?

Playlab now supports Escalating Flagged Conversations, allowing builders, workspace owners, and organization admins to receive notifications when conversations with their apps contain moderated or flagged content. You can now review these conversations and ensure your apps maintain high-quality interactions.

<Note>
  All automatically moderated messages and manually flagged inappropriate messages are hidden from view in the conversation by default to protect users from potentially inappropriate content.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Moderation is still in beta and will occasionally make mistakes.
</Warning>

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" /> Rationale for the feature

Playlab users have been asking for improved visibility into moderated or flagged conversations with their apps. With Escalating Flagged Conversations, administrators are promptly notified when moderation occurs, enhancing transparency and enabling quick action.

This feature makes it simple to identify and review potentially problematic conversations, allowing you to update your apps as needed and maintain a safe, high-quality user experience.

This feature also allows users to flag conversations that they deem to be inappropriate or biased. This will then inform the creator of the app via email.

### User Flagged Conversation

User flagged conversations trigger immediate notifications to app creators, empowering users to provide direct feedback on conversations they find problematic.

### Reviewing Flagged Conversations

The flagged conversation review interface provides a streamlined workflow for administrators to assess, address, and resolve reported issues efficiently. You can see separate icons for flagged user conversations and messages that were moderated. They will appear in the activity page of your Playlab workspace.

### Automatic Moderation Notifications:

When a message is automatically moderated (either input or output), the app creator, workspace owner, and organization admin will receive an email notification different from manually flagged conversations.![image.png](/image.png)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Workspace Activity">
    Access your workspace activity page to view all conversations

    <img
      height="600"
      src="/images/workspaceflag.png"
      alt="workspace flags"
      className="border border-gray-300 rounded-md shadow-sm"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter by Conversation Type">
    Use the new Conversation Type filter to quickly find flagged or moderated conversations

    <img
      height="600"
      src="/images/escalatingflagged.png"
      alt="conversation type filter"
      className="border border-gray-300 rounded-md shadow-sm"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the flagged conversation">
    Click on the conversation to open the full thread to review any messages

    <img
      height="600"
      src="/images/reviewflagactivity.png"
      alt="messages"
      className="border border-gray-300 rounded-md shadow-sm"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="View moderated content">
    Use the "Show Message" toggle to reveal the moderated message content (only available to authorized users)

    <img
      height="600"
      src="/moderated-content-review.png"
      alt="Review moderated message"
      className="border border-gray-300 rounded-md shadow-sm"
      title="Moderated Content Review"
    />

    The toggle will display:

    - The full content of the moderated message
    - The category of violation (e.g., "Moderated for: violence")
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Remember that moderated content may contain inappropriate material. Review with caution.

### Best Practices

- **Respond promptly to notifications**: Review flagged conversations as soon as possible to address any issues with your app.
- **Analyze patterns in flagged content**: Look for trends in the types of content being flagged to identify potential improvements for your app.
- **Update your app's instructions**: If you notice recurring issues, consider updating your app's instructions to prevent similar problems.
- **Follow up with users when appropriate**: For identified users experiencing issues, consider reaching out to provide support or clarification.
- **Document your resolution steps**: Keep track of how you resolve flagged conversations to improve your response in the future.
- **Consider required guardrails**: For apps dealing with sensitive topics, implement clear guardrails in your instructions to prevent moderation issues.
