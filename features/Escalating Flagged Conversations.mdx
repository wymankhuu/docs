## <Icon icon="bell-on" size="24" /> What is this feature?

Playlab now supports Escalating Flagged Conversations, allowing builders, workspace owners, and organization admins to review when conversations with their apps contain moderated or flagged content. You can now review these conversations and ensure your apps maintain high-quality interactions.

<Note>
  All moderated messages and manually flagged inappropriate messages are hidden from view in the conversation by default to protect users from potentially inappropriate content.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Moderation is still in beta and will occasionally make mistakes. \
  \
  We are in the process of testing an improved user input moderation solution - expect changes in the upcoming weeks.
</Warning>

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" /> Rationale for the feature

Playlab users have been asking for improved visibility into moderated or flagged conversations with their apps. With Escalating Flagged Conversations, administrators are promptly notified when moderation occurs, enhancing transparency and enabling quick action.

This feature makes it simple to identify and review potentially problematic conversations, allowing you to update your apps as needed and maintain a safe, high-quality user experience.

This feature also allows users to flag conversations that they deem to be inappropriate or biased. This will then inform the creator of the app via email.

### Reviewing Flagged Conversations

The flagged conversation review interface provides a streamlined workflow for administrators to assess, address, and resolve reported issues efficiently. You can see separate icons for flagged user conversations and messages that were moderated. They will appear in the activity page of your Playlab workspace.

### Best Practices

- **Analyze patterns in flagged content**: Look for trends in the types of content being flagged to identify potential improvements for your app.
- **Update your app's instructions**: If you notice recurring issues, consider updating your app's instructions to prevent similar problems.
- **Follow up with users when appropriate**: For identified users experiencing issues, consider reaching out to provide support or clarification.
- **Document your resolution steps**: Keep track of how you resolve flagged conversations to improve your response in the future.
- **Consider required guardrails**: For apps dealing with sensitive topics, implement clear guardrails in your instructions to prevent moderation issues.
