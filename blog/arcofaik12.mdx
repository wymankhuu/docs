title: "AI in K-12 Education"
description: "Explore research-backed resources, practical guidance, and strategic frameworks about AI."
---
Generative AI has introduced both exciting opportunities and complex challenges for K-12 education. While many schools and systems are responding to immediate questions about ethics, implementation, and student use, these efforts are often fragmented and reactive. The field needs more than one-off guidance: it requires shared vision and coordinated action to leverage AI as a tool for long-term reimagination.

At Playlab, we recommend The Learning Accelerator's comprehensive approach because it moves beyond reactive responses to offer education leaders a strategic roadmap for AI integration. This moment is about more than managing risk: it's about designing toward possibility. We can lay the foundation for a more student-centered and future-ready education system by addressing urgent questions today with an eye towards the future.
