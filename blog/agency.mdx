When I was in sixth grade, I led my class in arguing before our local school board for the right to ride bikes to school. That presentation was the culmination of a year-long effort. At the time, we didn't know what we were doing. But we had a secret power: Our teacher.

Every Friday, our sixth grade teacher, Mr. Arthur Rodeo, invited us to bring our chairs into a circle in the back of the room. Someone would pull a slip of paper with a scribbled question from a basket–and we'd debate. One question, 'Why can't we ride bikes to school?' really fired us up. What could we do about it, we demanded? And Mr. Rodeo pointed out a path: We surveyed other students. We circulated petitions. We raised money for bike racks. And finally we stood in front of the school board and asked for a rule change. And yep–we won.

What we learned that year was we, kids, had agency: We saw a need for change. Our teacher guided us to action. And we made a difference in our immediate community.

Through my career, I've taken cues from similar feelings of deep commitment – whether that meant joining The Washington Post, founding EdSurge or leading the board of the nonprofit high school, d-tech, which champions design thinking. And now, I'm delighted to share the newest such move: I'm joining **Playlab.ai** as the organization's director of strategic initiatives.

More than ever, I believe that teachers and schools can be a powerful place to help young people experiment with and exercise their own agency. And of all the organizations I see on the tumultuous AI landscape, Playlab is the most committed to bolstering human agency.

AI is not magic; it's math. I started talking and writing about AI as a cub reporter decades ago at IEEE Spectrum. One of the people who deeply influenced my thinking was Dr. John Seely Brown, who became head of Xerox PARC. Although we think of PARC as the place that birthed graphical user interfaces, the computer mouse and networking, what fascinated JSB the most was the human dimension of technology–how using tech led to changes in how we interacted with other people. He brought anthropologists to PARC.

How we use technology–and how it changes us–stubbornly persists as one of our deepest challenges. JSB is still exploring that question; this week on Future Fluent, the podcast on AI that I co host with Dr. Jeremy Roschelle of Digital Promise, JSB talked about the power of play and how we all need to "read the context" of this crazy, changing world–and how the most crucial skill for students to build is agency.

Playlab, led by the thoughtful duo of Yusuf Ahmad and Ian Serlin, is all about agency. It offers a framework for educators and students to experiment, play and learn about AI by making apps that serve them. Its platform builds on top of LLMs like GPT, Claude and Llama, and asks: What do educators and students need for these tools to work for them? (Hint: let's start with better guardrails.) Playlab insists that educators start with professional development before plunging in. It invites them to build in community–with each other. To remix and improve on the apps created by others. Finally, it's trying to sidestep the most corrosive effects of blitzscaling – of promising before delivering, of sacrificing everything in the race for profits.

Those values ring true to me. And so, I am truly excited to do whatever I can to help Playlab build infrastructure that aims to help humans stay in charge of one of the most powerful technologies we've ever devised.

Let me know what you think! And especially, drop me a note if you want to support this journey to build human agency.
