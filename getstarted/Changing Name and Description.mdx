Keeping your app details current helps others understand what your app does and makes it easier to find in your workspace. There are two methods to update your app name: through the settings panel or directly from the title bar.

<Note>
  **Naming for Accessibility**
  
  Choose names that are descriptive and memorable. If your app is intended for others to discover, use clear, searchable terms that accurately reflect its functionality. This makes your app more accessible and easier to find in shared workspaces.
