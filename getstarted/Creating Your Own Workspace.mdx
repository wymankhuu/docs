In Playlab, workspaces provide dedicated environments to build, test, and manage your applications. This guide explains how workspace creation works and who can create them.

<Note>
  **Workspace Creation Requirements**
  
  To create a workspace in Playlab, you must be a member of an organization with the **Creator** or **Owner/Admin** role or above. 
</Note>

If you had a workspace before this update, your existing workspaces and links will continue to work. 

If your workspace is part of a larger organization, it may be automatically migrated to your associated organization.

## <Icon icon="building" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Who Can Create Workspaces?

Workspace creation is available to:

- **Organization members** with Creator, Admin, or Owner roles

If you have a non organizational Playlab account and need to create workspaces, contact your organization administrator to be added to an organization with the appropriate role.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Workspace Creation">
    **Navigate to the workspace creation section.**
    
    1. From your Playlab dashboard, click the workspace selector dropdown in the top navigation
    2. Select **"+ New Workspace"** option at the bottom of the dropdown
    3. This will open the workspace creation form
    
    <Note>
      If you don't see the "+ New Workspace" option, you may not have the required role. Contact your organization administrator for access.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name Your Workspace">
    1. Enter a descriptive name for your workspace (e.g., "Math Department Apps")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Finalize Workspace Creation">
    **Complete the setup process.**
    
    1. Review your workspace details to ensure everything is correct
    2. Click the **"Create Workspace"** button to finalize
    3. Your new workspace will be initialized
    4. You'll automatically be assigned as the Owner of this workspace
    
    <Warning>
      **Remember:** As the creator, you're automatically the Owner with full administrative rights. You can add team members later if needed.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize Your Workspace (Optional)">
    **Make your workspace your own.**
    
    1. Navigate to workspace settings
    2. Configure workspace-wide settings and preferences
    3. Remix any apps from other workspaces into this workspace that you'd like

    <Tip>If you'd like to delete the original app, make sure you archive the previous app.</Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

There are several important benefits to creating workspaces in Playlab:

- **Privacy Control**: Only you and invited members can access apps in your workspace, protecting sensitive information
- **Full Ownership**: You have complete control over all aspects of your workspace as the Owner
- **Customization**: Tailor the environment to your specific workflows and preferences
- **Organizational Freedom**: Structure your projects however you prefer without affecting others
- **Testing Ground**: Safely experiment with new app ideas before sharing them publicly
- **Focused Environment**: Work without distraction from other team members' activities
- **Publishing Flexibility**: Choose which apps to keep private and which to publish publicly
- **Role Management**: Assign appropriate access levels when you bring collaborators into your projects

## <Icon icon="user-group" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Understanding Workspace Roles

When adding members to your workspace, you'll assign them one of these roles:

- **Owners (Admins)**: Have full control, including adding/removing members and changing roles
- **Creators**: Can build and edit apps but cannot manage workspace membership
- **Reviewers**: Can view app activity and structure but cannot make edits
- **Explorers**: Can only use published apps within the workspace

Choose roles carefully based on how much access you want team members to have to your projects.

<Accordion title="What happened to my existing workspace after the update?">
  If you had a workspace before this update, don't worry. Your existing workspaces and all associated links will continue to function normally. If your workspace was part of a larger organization, it has been automatically migrated to that organization. You don't need to take any action.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I don't see the option to create a workspace. Why?">
  Workspace creation requires you to be a member of an organization with the Creator role or above. Regular accounts without an organization cannot create private workspaces.
  
  To get workspace creation access:
  1. Join an existing organization and request a Creator role or above
  2. Contact your organization administrator to upgrade your role
  3. Reach out to Playlab support if you believe you should have access
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I have multiple workspaces?">
  Yes, you can create multiple workspaces within your organization. This can be useful for separating different types of projects or maintaining distinct environments for various purposes (e.g., one for math apps, another for science experiments).
  
  Each workspace functions independently with its own members, settings, and apps.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is my workspace private?">
  Yes, your workspace is private by default. Only you can see and access it until you explicitly invite other members. 
  
  Even when you publish apps publicly, users outside your workspace will only see the published app itself, not your workspace structure or other private apps.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I transfer apps between workspaces?">
  Yes! You can move apps between workspaces within your organization. You can also remix an app from one workspace to another, which creates a copy rather than moving the original app.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I remix public apps into my workspace?">
  Yes, you can remix public apps into your workspace. When you find a public app you'd like to build upon:
  
  1. Open the public app you want to remix
  2. Click the "Remix" button
  3. Select your workspace as the destination
  4. The app will be copied to your workspace where you can modify it privately
  
  This allows you to build upon public examples while keeping your improvements private to your workspace.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I delete my workspace?">
  Deleting a workspace is permanent and cannot be undone. When you delete your workspace:
  
  - All apps within the workspace will be permanently deleted
  - All workspace settings and configurations will be lost
  - Team members will lose access to everything in the workspace
  - Published apps from that workspace will be unpublished
  
  Consider remixing important apps before deletion if you want to preserve them.
