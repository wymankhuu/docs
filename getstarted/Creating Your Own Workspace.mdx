description: 'Set up a private workspace to build and manage your own Playlab apps'
---

In Playlab, creating your own personal workspace gives you a dedicated environment to build, test, and manage your applications. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your personal workspace and explain why having one is valuable for your productivity and privacy.

<Info>
  **Privacy & Control Matter**
  
  Your personal workspace creates a secure environment where only invited team members can access your apps and resources. This is essential for projects containing sensitive information or works-in-progress you're not ready to share broadly.

There are several important benefits to creating your own personal Playlab workspace:

- **Privacy Control**: Only you and invited members can access apps in your personal workspace, protecting sensitive information
- **Full Ownership**: You have complete control over all aspects of your workspace as the Owner
- **Customization**: Tailor the environment to your specific workflows and preferences
- **Organizational Freedom**: Structure your projects however you prefer without affecting others
- **Testing Ground**: Safely experiment with new app ideas before sharing them publicly
- **Intellectual Property Protection**: Keep proprietary developments secure within your private workspace
- **Focused Environment**: Work without distraction from other team members' activities
- **Publishing Flexibility**: Choose which apps to keep private and which to publish publicly
- **Role Management**: Assign appropriate access levels when you bring collaborators into your projects

## <Icon icon="user-group" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Understanding Workspace Roles

When adding members to your personal workspace, you'll assign them one of these roles:

- **Owners (Admins)**: Have full control, including adding/removing members and changing roles
- **Creators**: Can build and edit apps but cannot manage workspace membership
- **Reviewers**: Can view app activity and structure but cannot make edits
- **Explorers**: Can only use published apps within the workspace

Choose roles carefully based on how much access you want team members to have to your personal projects.

<Accordion title="Can I have multiple personal workspaces?">
  Yes, you can create multiple personal workspaces in Playlab. This can be useful for separating different types of projects or maintaining distinct environments for various purposes (e.g., one for professional projects, another for personal experiments).
  
  Each workspace functions independently with its own members, settings, and apps.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is my personal workspace completely private?">
  Yes, your personal workspace is entirely private by default. Only you can see and access it until you explicitly invite other members. 
  
  Even when you publish apps publicly, users outside your workspace will only see the published app itself, not your workspace structure or other private apps.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I transfer apps between workspaces?">
  Currently, direct transfers between workspaces aren't supported. However, you can:
  
  1. Remix an app from one workspace to another.
  2. Make any necessary adjustments after import
  
  This process creates a copy rather than moving the original app.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I remix public apps into my private workspace?">
  Yes, you can remix public apps into your private workspace. When you find a public app you'd like to build upon:
  
  1. Open the public app you want to remix
  2. Click the "Remix" button
  3. Select your personal workspace as the destination
  4. The app will be copied to your workspace where you can modify it privately
  
  This allows you to build upon public examples while keeping your improvements private to your workspace.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I delete my personal workspace?">
  Deleting a workspace is permanent and cannot be undone. When you delete your personal workspace:
  
  - All apps within the workspace will be permanently deleted
  - All workspace settings and configurations will be lost
  - Team members will lose access to everything in the workspace
  - Published apps from that workspace will be unpublished
  
  Consider Remixing important apps before deletion if you want to preserve them.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I change my workspace from private to public later?">
  Playlab currently doesn't support changing a workspace's privacy setting after creation. You would need to:
  
  1. Create a new workspace with the desired privacy setting
  2. Export apps from your private workspace
  3. Import them into the new workspace
  
  For this reason, it's important to consider your privacy needs carefully when first creating your workspace.
