<Warning>
  **Enterprise Feature**
  
  Image inputs are an enterprise-only feature. Contact your organization administrator if you need access to this capability.
</Warning>

Image inputs allow users to upload images to your Playlab app, enabling visual interactions and image-based workflows. Before you can use this feature, it must be enabled at both the organization and app levels.

Before adding image inputs to your app, ensure:

* Your organization has an enterprise plan
* You have admin access to organization settings (or can request an admin to enable the feature)
* You are the creator or have edit access to the app you want to modify

  </Step>
</Steps>

## <Icon icon="image" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Using Image Inputs

Once enabled, users can send images to your app in several ways:

* **Upload**: Click the image icon in the chat input to upload an image file
* **Drag and Drop**: Drag an image file directly into the chat window

Your app can then process, analyze, or respond to these images based on your builder instructions.

When working with image inputs in your Playlab app:

* **Be clear about expectations**: Tell users what types of images your app can process
* **Set appropriate limits**: Consider file size and format limitations in your instructions
* **Handle errors gracefully**: Provide helpful feedback when images cannot be processed
* **Privacy considerations**: Be transparent about how images are used and stored
* **Test thoroughly**: Try various image types and sizes before publishing
