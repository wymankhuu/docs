In order to add context and background information for your Playlab app, you can upload reference documents or links to fine-tune your app's performance. Think of external references as giving your Playlab app additional knowledge to guide its responses.
<Info>
Playlab now supports multiple file uploads (up to 10 files at once) for efficient setup of your app.

## <Icon icon="circle-check" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Using References Effectively

References require fine-tuning to get the best results. Be specific in your app instructions on how and when to leverage the reference files.

### Examples of Effective Reference Usage:

<Accordion title="For specific content requirements">
  - "Using the attached syllabus, generate a weekly schedule for the 'Introduction to Biology' course"
  - "Referring to the list of Illustrative Mathematics 7th-grade math concepts and real-world scenarios, create a set of 10 word problems that apply algebraic thinking to everyday situations"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="For safety guidelines and project requirements">
  - "Based on the provided science fair rulebook, generate a checklist for students to ensure their projects meet all safety and presentation requirements"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What NOT to use references for">
  - "Suggest creative and engaging science fair project ideas suitable for 7th-grade students across various scientific disciplines"
  - General brainstorming where specific source material isn't required
</Accordion>

## <Icon icon="star" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> References Best Practices

When adding references to your Playlab app, keep these tips in mind:

<Accordion title="Quality Over Quantity">
  - **Start Small**: Begin with 3-5 core references that cover your app's main functionality
  - **Expand Gradually**: Add more references as needed. More is not always better
  - **Quality Over Quantity**: Prioritize comprehensive, high-quality references over a large number of superficial ones
  - **Use Batch Upload Wisely**: The ability to upload 10 files at once is great for efficiency, but ensure each file serves a clear purpose
  
  ðŸ’¡ For each reference you add, ask yourself: does this improve the output? If it does not, it might not be worth including.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="File Formatting">
  - **Use Appropriate Formats**: Choose formats that preserve formatting and are easily parsed (e.g., PDF, markdown, structured text)
  - **Optimize File Sizes**: Large files can slow down processing. Break up very large documents into smaller, focused files
  - **Ensure Readability**: Use clear formatting and structure within documents for easier AI parsing
  - **Tables > Paragraphs**: Tables are much stronger reference files since they're easier for the AI to parse and categorize information
  - **Organize Before Upload**: When uploading multiple files, organize them logically and ensure they complement each other
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Testing and Refinement">
  - Test your apps with references checked and unchecked to verify if the references are helping
  - Sometimes key information from a reference is best just inserted into the prompt itself
  - When using multiple references, test to ensure they work well together and don't create conflicting information
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Additional Tips">
  - **Curate Carefully**: Choose high-quality, relevant resources that align with your educational objectives
  - **Be Specific**: Clearly instruct the AI on how to use the provided resources
  - **Combine Resources**: Use multiple types of resources for more comprehensive responses
  - **Update Regularly**: Especially for public links, ensure your resources stay current
  - **Respect Copyright**: Always use resources that you have permission to use or that are openly licensed
  - **Group Related Files**: When uploading multiple files, consider grouping related content together for better organization
</Accordion>

## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="What types of files can I upload as references?">
  Playlab supports various reference formats including PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, JSON, and XLSX files. Each file has a maximum size limit of 30 MB, and you can upload up to 10 files at once.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many references should I add to my app?">
  Start with 3-5 core references that cover your app's main functionality. Quality is more important than quantity. Each reference should have a clear purpose and improve your app's output. While you can upload up to 10 files at once, focus on relevance over volume.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I upload multiple files at the same time?">
  Yes! You can now upload up to 10 files simultaneously. Simply hold Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (Mac) while selecting your files. All files must be in supported formats and under 30 MB each. This feature is designed to streamline your workflow when setting up apps with multiple reference materials.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the best way to organize multiple file uploads?">
  When uploading multiple files at once, organize them by topic or purpose before uploading. For example, group all curriculum documents together, or upload related worksheets and answer keys in the same batch. This helps ensure your references work well together and don't create conflicting information.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do all files upload at the same time, or one by one?">
  When you select multiple files, they all upload simultaneously in the background. You'll see a progress indicator showing the overall upload status. If one file fails to upload, the others will still process successfully.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I mix different file types in a single upload?">
  Absolutely! You can select a combination of PDFs, Word documents, text files, CSVs, JSON files, and Excel spreadsheets in a single upload session, as long as you don't exceed the 10-file limit.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are Global References?">
  Global References are available as building blocks for all Playlab users. These include curricula and standards, starting with Illustrative Mathematics, with more coming soon.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I know if my references are being used effectively?">
  Test your app with references checked and unchecked to verify if they're improving the output. If you don't see a difference, you might need to be more specific in your instructions about how to use the references.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I try to upload more than 10 files?">
  The system will limit you to 10 files per upload session. If you need to add more references, you can perform multiple upload sessions or remove existing references to make room for new ones.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if one file fails during a multiple file upload?">
  If one file encounters an error (such as unsupported format or file too large), the other files in your selection will continue to upload successfully. You'll receive a notification about which specific file failed and why, so you can address the issue and re-upload if needed.
</Accordion>
