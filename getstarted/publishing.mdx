<Accordion title="Can I unpublish my app after I've published it?">
  Yes, you can unpublish your app at any time. Navigate to your app in the workspace, click on the "**Publish**" menu, and select **"Not Published."** This will remove it from public view or workspace visibility, depending on your original publishing scope.
  
  Note that if users have already remixed your app, their remixes will continue to exist independently.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I update my app after publishing it?">
  Absolutely! You can continue to make changes to your app after publishing. Simply make your edits in the editor and click "Update Published Version" to push your changes to the published app.
  
  Keep in mind that significant changes might confuse existing users, so consider adding a "What's New" section to your app description when making major updates.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Who can see my published app?">
  This depends on your publishing scope:
  
  - If published to your workspace only, only members of your workspace can see and use your app.
  - If published publicly, anyone in the Playlab community can discover and use your app.
  
  You can always change the publishing scope later if you want to expand or restrict access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will I receive credit for apps I publish?">
  Yes, your name (or username) will be displayed as the creator of the app. If someone remixes your app, your original app will be credited as the source.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I monetize my published apps?">
  Currently, Playlab does not offer direct monetization features for published apps. However, you can use your published apps to showcase your skills and expertise, which might lead to professional opportunities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if my app contains sensitive information?">
  Be careful not to include sensitive or confidential information in apps you publish publicly. Any information included in your app's prompts, instructions, or references could potentially be viewed by others.
  
  For apps containing sensitive information, publish to your workspace only or keep them in draft mode.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I see how many people have used my published app?">
  Not yet, Playlab is working on providing analytics for published apps. You will be able to see metrics such as the number of views, uses, and remixes. These analytics can help you understand how popular your app is and how users are engaging with it.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I feature my app in the Playlab Community?">
  The most popular and high-quality apps may be featured in the Playlab Community. To increase your chances:
  
  - Create a polished, useful app with a clear purpose
  - Gather positive feedback and engagement from users

  The Playlab team regularly reviews apps for featuring in the community showcase.
