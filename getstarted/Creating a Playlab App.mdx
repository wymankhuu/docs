  <Step title="Write Your AI Instructions">
    We will start with the basics to help you create your Playlab app. Over time, you will learn additional AI building strategies and build AI intuition to help you improve your AI apps.
    
    1. Start by completing the **Background** section of your prompt:
       >- You are an expert in: *This is where you will enter what you want your AI app to have domain or content expertise in* 
       >- Your role is: *This is where you will enter what the main function of the AI app is*
       >- You are talking to: *This is where you will enter who your target audience(s) are for the app*
    
    2. Now let's get started on the **Workflow** section of your prompt:
       >- The workflow section is where you will guide your AI by telling it the steps you want the AI to take as it is interacting with the user.
          >- **Step 1:** *What is the first question you want the AI to ask the user?*
          >- **Step 2:** *What is the next question or step you want the AI to take to accomplish the intended function of the app?*
          >- **Step 3:** *Based on the response of the user, what do you want the AI to do next?*
          >- ‚ùó You can have as many or as few steps as you need.
    
    3. Once you're satisfied with your workflow, you should now review the **Guidelines & Guardrails** section:
       >- By default, there will be some preexisting Guidelines & Guardrails
         >- You are able to edit these, but they are a good start
         >- Feel free to add any other additional guidelines or guardrails you'd like the AI to adhere to
