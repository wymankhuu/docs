Consider these recommendations when creating documentation in the Design tab:

- **Start with a clear introduction** explaining what your app does and its primary benefits
- **Include step-by-step instructions** for common use cases
- **Add screenshots or GIFs** to illustrate key features

- **Structure content with headings** for better readability
- **Use callouts for important notes** or warnings

<Accordion title="Will my Design Tab be visible in the published app?">
  Yes, the content you create in the Design tab will be visible to all users who have access to your app. It appears as a dedicated Documentation tab in the published version.
  
  This makes it an essential part of the user experience for your application.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I import content from another source?">
  Currently, there's no direct import feature. However, you can copy and paste content from other sources, and the editor will preserve most formatting.
  
  For more complex imports, you might need to adjust formatting after pasting.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is there a limit to how much documentation I can add?">
  There is no strict limit, but extremely large design tabs are not as effective.
</Accordion>
