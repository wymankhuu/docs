When you no longer need an app or want to remove it from your workspace, in Playlab we call it **Archiving** your app. This guide will show you how to properly manage your Playlab apps when they're no longer needed.

<Warning>
  **Permanent Action**
  
  Archiving an app is a permanent action. Once archived, an app cannot be recovered. Make sure you want to proceed before confirming.

## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="Is app archiving permanent?">
  Yes, archiving an app permanently removes it from your workspace. This action cannot be undone. Make sure you're certain about deleting the app before proceeding with archiving.
  
  If you think you might need the app in the future, consider remixing it first as a backup.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens to shared apps when I archive them?">
  When you archive a shared app, it's removed for all users who have access to it. Make sure to communicate with your team before deleting shared resources.
  
  Team members will no longer be able to access, use, or modify the app after it has been archived.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I recover an archived app?">
  Currently, you cannot recover an archived Playlab app. Archiving is a permanent action, and there is no built-in recovery process.
  
  This is why it's important to be certain before proceeding with archiving any app.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will archiving an app free up storage space?">
  Yes, archiving apps helps maintain a clean workspace and can free up storage allocated to your account. This can be especially helpful if you have many unused apps taking up space.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I archive multiple apps at once?">
  No, you must archive apps individually. There is currently no batch archiving feature. You'll need to go through the archive confirmation process for each app separately.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is there a limit to how many apps I can archive?">
  There is no limit to the number of apps you can archive. You can archive as many apps as needed to keep your workspace organized and manageable.
