</Note>

## <Icon icon="bell-on" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this feature?

You can now build on top of even more LLMs in Playlab! There are now over 20 available AI models for you to build your Playlab apps on top of. We will try our best to always provide the latest models for you to build on top of.

<Warning>
  Changing the LLM may impact the performance of your app.
</Warning>

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Rationale for the feature

This feature allows Playlab users to experiment with and leverage the unique strengths of various AI models from different providers all within Playlab.

As you build, you might find that certain models perform better at different tasks. This will allow Playlab users to select the model that fits their needs better. The more available models, the more likely you are to find one that meets your needs. We believe that Playlabbers should have access to frontier models as we build in community.

## <Icon icon="thought-bubble" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Understanding Model Types

Before selecting a model, it's helpful to understand the different categories of AI models available:

| **Frontier Models** | **Open Weight Models** | **Open Source Models** |
|---|---|---|
| Cutting-edge, proprietary models developed by major AI companies | Models with publicly available parameters (weights) that can be downloaded and run independently | Fully open models where both weights and training code are publicly available |
| Typically offer the most advanced capabilities and are continuously updated with the latest research breakthroughs | While training code may not be available, you have more control over deployment and customization | Offer maximum transparency and customization potential |
| Examples: Claude 4 models, GPT-5 series, GPT-4 series, Gemini models | Examples: Llama models, DeepSeek R1, GPT OSS models, Kimi K2, Qwen 3 | Coming soon! |

## <Icon icon="thought-bubble" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> How do I access these models?
