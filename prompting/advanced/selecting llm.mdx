title: 'Selecting an LLM'
description: 'Choose the perfect AI model for your Playlab application'
---

## <Icon icon="bell-on" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this feature?

You can now build on top of even more LLMs in Playlab! There are now 13 available AI models for you to build your Playlab apps on top of. We will try our best to always provide the latest models for you to build on top of.

<Warning>
  Changing the LLM may impact the performance of your app.
</Warning>

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Rationale for the feature

This feature allows Playlab users to experiment with and leverage the unique strengths of various AI models from different providers all within Playlab.

As you build, you might find that certain models perform better at different tasks. This will allow Playlab users to select the model that fits their needs better. The more available models, the more likely you are to find one that meets your needs. We believe that Playlabbers should have access to frontier models as we build in community.

## <Icon icon="thought-bubble" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> How do I access these models?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the LLM selector">
    On the top left click the LLM. (By default it will be Claude 4 Sonnet)
    
    <img height="500" src="/images/Selectinganllm.gif" className="border border-gray-300 rounded-md shadow-sm" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your model">
    From the menu, select which LLM you want to build on top of.
