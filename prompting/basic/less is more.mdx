## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this strategy?

Less is More is a prompting strategy that focuses on keeping instructions simple, clear, and focused. Rather than overloading the AI with complex, detailed instructions, you provide concise guidance to get more targeted and useful responses.

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Why It's Important

Using simpler, more focused prompts helps the AI generate clearer, more relevant outputs. This approach:

* Reduces confusion and ambiguity
* Improves response quality and relevance
* Makes it easier to iterate and refine your prompts
* Prevents the AI from trying to address too many requirements at once
* Produces more actionable and useful outputs

<Steps>
    <Step title="Go to the Playlab Builder">
      Go to the Playlab Builder and take a look at your existing prompt.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Identify Your Core Goal">
      Determine the single most important outcome you want from the AI:
      
      - What is the primary task or goal?
      - What specific information do you need?
      - What problem are you trying to solve?
    <Tip>
      Think of the AI as an intern who has skills but needs clear guidance around context.
    </Tip>
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Streamline Your Prompt">
      Remove unnecessary complexity:
      
      - Cut out redundant instructions
      - Eliminate unnecessary context
      - Focus on one main request at a time
      - Use straightforward language
      <Warning> Avoid the temptation to add "just one more thing" to your prompt </Warning>
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Refine and Iterate">
      Start simple and add complexity only when necessary:
      
      - Begin with a basic prompt
      - Test the results
      - Add additional guidance only if needed
      - Focus on quality over quantity
    </Step>
</Steps>

    Design a comprehensive, multi-faceted lesson plan for high school students aimed at developing critical thinking skills across various subjects including science, literature, history, and current events. The lesson should incorporate Bloom's Taxonomy, multiple intelligences theory, and metacognitive strategies. Include specific activities for analyzing biases, evaluating sources, constructing logical arguments, and applying critical thinking to real-world problems. Provide detailed instructions for both individual and group exercises, assessment rubrics, differentiation strategies for diverse learners, and suggestions for integrating technology and multimedia resources. Additionally, outline potential cross-curricular connections and extensions for gifted students.

## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="How do I know if my prompt is too complex?">
  If your prompt contains multiple unrelated requests, spans more than a few sentences, or includes numerous constraints and specifications, it may be too complex. Another sign is if the AI's response seems confused, addresses only part of your request, or mixes up different aspects of your instructions. Try breaking your prompt into smaller, focused requests and see if the responses improve.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can a prompt be too simple?">
  Yes, prompts that are too vague or lack necessary context can also lead to poor results. The key is finding balance—include enough information to guide the AI toward your desired outcome, but not so much that it becomes overwhelming. If your results are too generic or miss the mark, try adding a bit more specific guidance while keeping the overall prompt concise.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Should I always use the simplest possible prompt?">
  Not necessarily. The ideal prompt length and complexity depend on your specific needs. For straightforward tasks, a simple prompt is often best. For more complex requirements, you may need additional guidance—but even then, focus on clarity and relevance rather than volume of instructions. Always ask if each element of your prompt adds value; if not, leave it out.
