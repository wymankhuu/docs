## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this strategy?

This strategy emphasizes the power of well-structured prompts in creating effective Playlab apps. By organizing your instructions in a clear, logical format with lists, bullets, and consistent formatting, you can dramatically improve the quality and precision of your app's outputs.

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Why It's Important

Structured prompts are like detailed blueprints for your Playlab apps. Well-organized instructions lead to well-organized responses.
  
  * Helps the AI process information more effectively
  * Makes it easier to identify and fix errors in your prompts
  * Creates more predictable and consistent outputs
  * Ensures all important elements are included in the response

<Steps>
    <Step title="Go to the Playlab Builder">
      Go to the Playlab Builder and take a look at your existing prompt.

      </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Prioritize Key Information">
      Arrange your prompt content from most important to least important:
      
      - Identify the essential instructions that define your app's core functionality
      - Place critical information at the beginning of your prompt
      - Group related items together logically
      - Use consistent formatting throughout your prompt
      
      Well-prioritized information helps your Playlab app focus on the most important aspects first.
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Use Lists and Formatting">
      Apply formatting tools to create clear visual organization:
      
      - Use numbered lists for sequential instructions or steps
      - Apply bullet points for non-sequential but related items
      - Create sections with clear headings for different instruction categories
      - Maintain consistent formatting patterns throughout your prompt
      
      Proper formatting makes your instructions more scannable and easier to follow.
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Specify Response Format">
      Clearly communicate how you want information presented:
      
      - Define the specific structure you want in the app's outputs
      - Provide section-specific instructions where needed
      - Use teacher-like instructions to guide the output quality
      - Consider structuring prompts like a lesson plan with outcomes, steps, and examples
    </Step>

## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="Which is better: numbered lists or bullet points?">
  Each has its purpose. Use numbered lists for sequential steps or prioritized items where order matters. Use bullet points for related items where the sequence isn't important. The best choice depends on your specific needs and the type of information you're organizing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I be too structured in my prompts?">
  While structure is beneficial, extreme rigidity might limit creativity when that's needed. Balance structure with enough flexibility to allow for appropriate creativity and adaptation. The right balance depends on your app's specific purpose.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I know if my prompt structure is effective?">
  Test your structured prompt and evaluate the results. If the output matches your expectations and contains all the required elements in a logical order, your structure is working well. If not, refine the structure and test again.
</Accordion>
