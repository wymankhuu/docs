description: 'Improve Playlab outputs by instructing the AI what to avoid or exclude'

## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this strategy?

Negative Prompting instructs AI by specifying what to avoid or exclude in its output. Rather than telling the AI what to do, you're telling the AI what to try and avoid in its responses.

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Why It's Important

Using negative prompting helps define boundaries and refine AI responses by clarifying what should be excluded. This approach:

* Helps avoid unwanted content
* Improves output quality and relevance
* Provides clearer guardrails for the AI
* Reduces the likelihood of inappropriate or off-target responses
* Is particularly effective for refining AI outputs

<Steps>
    <Step title="Go to the Playlab Builder">
      Go to the Playlab Builder and take a look at your existing prompt.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Start with a Positive Instruction">
      Begin with clear guidance on what you want the AI to do:
      
      - Define the primary task or goal
      - Specify the desired format and tone
      - Outline any essential elements to include
    <Tip>
      Creating a strong foundation with positive instructions gives the AI a clear direction before applying constraints.
    </Tip>
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Apply Negative Prompting">
      Add specific guidance on what to avoid:
      
      - Use clear "don't" or "avoid" language
      - Be specific about what should be excluded
      - Focus on categories of content rather than exhaustive lists
      - Consider potential pitfalls relevant to your use case
      <Warning> Avoid double negatives and make sure it's clear what you want the AI to omit </Warning>
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Refine and Balance">
      Find the right balance between positive and negative prompting instructions:
      
      - Start with broad negative prompts and get more specific
      - Observe how negative prompts affect AI output
      - Balance restrictions against creative freedom
      - Sometimes repeat important negative constraints for emphasis
    </Step>

## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="How many negative constraints should I include?">
  There's no fixed number, but aim for balance. Too few constraints may not adequately guide the AI, while too many might be confusing or overly restrictive. Start with 2-3 key constraints, test the results, and adjust as needed. Focus on the most important exclusions rather than trying to list every possible thing to avoid.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When is negative prompting more effective than positive instructions?">
  Negative prompting works particularly well when trying to eliminate specific problems or edge cases that keep occurring in AI outputs. It's excellent for refinement after identifying issues with initial outputs, addressing safety concerns, or when there are many acceptable approaches but a few specific things to avoid.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I ensure my negative prompts don't accidentally restrict too much?">
  Test your prompts iteratively. After adding negative constraints, review the outputs to make sure the AI still has enough creative freedom to generate useful content. If outputs become too limited or generic, try relaxing some constraints or balancing them with additional positive guidance about what is acceptable.
