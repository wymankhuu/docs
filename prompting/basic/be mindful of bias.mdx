## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this strategy?

Be Mindful of Bias is a prompting strategy that focuses on creating fair and inclusive AI outputs. It recognizes that AI can reflect societal biases from its training data and creators, and works to actively mitigate these biases through careful prompt design.

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Why It's Important

Designing with bias awareness helps create more equitable and representative AI outputs. This approach:

* Prevents reinforcement of harmful stereotypes
* Ensures representation of diverse perspectives
* Creates more inclusive and accessible content
* Improves the accuracy and fairness of AI responses
* Builds trust with users from all backgrounds

<Note> Remember, if AI is trained on biased informnation, it can output biased information. </Note>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Examine Your Prompt for Bias">
      Review your existing prompt and identify potential bias points:
      
      - Does it make assumptions about gender, race, or ability?
      - Is it centered on specific cultural perspectives?
      - Does it reinforce stereotypes or exclude certain groups?
    <Tip>
      Think of AI as a mirror that reflects our world—including its biases. Your role is to help correct that reflection.
    </Tip>
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Use Inclusive Language">
      Modify your prompt to be more inclusive:
      
      - Use gender-neutral terms when gender isn't relevant
      - Consider diverse cultural contexts and backgrounds
      - Specify inclusion when appropriate (e.g., "consider people of all abilities")
      - Avoid assumptions about family structures, socioeconomic status, etc.
      <Warning> Be careful not to introduce tokenism or superficial diversity that doesn't address underlying bias </Warning>
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Test and Interrogate Results">
      Apply critical thinking to the AI's outputs:
      
      - Question whose perspectives might be missing
      - Look for subtle biases in language or representation
      - Consider alternative viewpoints
      - Test with different variations to see how bias manifests
      <Note> Ask others for their input. Know what you don't know and seek community input</Note>
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Refine and Iterate">
      Use what you learn to improve your prompts:
      
      - Adjust language to address discovered biases
      - Be explicit about inclusion when needed
      - Consider using Playlab's "Be Mindful of Bias" tool
      - Collaborate with diverse perspectives to identify blind spots
    </Step>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Audit Regularly" icon="clipboard-check" color="#4CAF50">
    • Review AI outputs for representational issues
    
    • Look for patterns of exclusion or stereotyping
    
    • Consider whose perspectives are centered
    
    • Check for assumptions about "normal" or "typical"
    
    • Ask diverse colleagues to review your prompts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Recognize Different Types of Bias" icon="glasses" color="#2196F3">
    • Representational bias (who is shown/not shown)
    
    • Allocational bias (how resources are distributed)
    
    • Quality of service bias (who is served better)
    
    • Stereotypical bias (reinforcing stereotypes)
    
    • Historical bias (reflecting historical inequities)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Diversify Input and Feedback" icon="users" color="#FF9800">
    • Involve diverse stakeholders in prompt design
    
    • Seek feedback from underrepresented groups
    
    • Enable user reporting of biased responses
    
    • Listen to criticism without defensiveness
    
    • Implement suggested improvements
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Explicitly Inclusive" icon="hand-holding-heart" color="#9C27B0">
    • Specify inclusion when appropriate
    
    • Consider intersectionality
    
    • Use people-first language
    
    • Avoid defaulting to dominant perspectives
    
    • Question your own assumptions regularly

## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="How do I know if my prompt contains bias?">
  Identifying bias requires ongoing reflection and awareness. Look for assumptions about what's "normal" or "typical," check if your prompt centers certain perspectives over others, and consider whether it might reinforce stereotypes or exclude certain groups. It can help to have people with different backgrounds review your prompts, as they may spot biases you've missed due to your own perspective.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Should I always explicitly mention inclusion in my prompts?">
  Not necessarily. While explicit inclusion can be helpful in many cases, the goal is to develop prompts that are inherently inclusive without needing to call attention to it. Sometimes being explicit is the right approach (e.g., "consider people of all genders"), while other times restructuring the prompt to avoid assumptions works better. Consider what's appropriate for your specific use case and audience.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is it possible to completely eliminate bias from AI?">
  Complete elimination of bias is extremely difficult, as AI systems reflect the data they're trained on and the societies that create them. However, by being mindful of bias and working actively to mitigate it, we can significantly reduce harmful biases in AI outputs. Think of addressing bias as an ongoing practice rather than a one-time fix—it requires continuous learning, testing, and refinement.
