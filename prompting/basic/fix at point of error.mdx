## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> What is this strategy?

Fix at the Point of Error is a prompting strategy that focuses on making targeted adjustments to your prompts when they don't perform as expected. Rather than rewriting entire prompts, this approach identifies specific issues and addresses them with precise modifications.

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Why It's Important

Fixing at the point of error helps create more effective prompts with less effort. This approach:

* Saves time by avoiding complete rewrites
* Helps identify specific issues in complex prompts
* Creates a clearer understanding of what works and what doesn't
* Enables incremental improvements through testing
* Builds your prompt engineering skills through focused problem-solving

<Note>
  The more complicated your prompt, the harder it is to identify the point of error, so test as you're building.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify the Specific Issue">
    Pinpoint exactly what's not working in your current prompt:
    
    - Is it giving too much or too little information?
    - Is it off-topic or missing key elements?
    - Is it structured in a confusing way?
    - Is it lacking necessary context or details?
    
    <Tip>
      Think of prompt refinement like adjusting a recipe. You wouldn't throw out the whole dish if it just needs a bit more salt.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Make Targeted Adjustments">
    Modify only the specific elements that need fixing:
    
    - Add structure if the response is too vague or unorganized
    - Specify content and depth if detail level is wrong
    - Include examples if the AI isn't understanding your intent
    - Add engagement elements if the content is dry or uninspiring
    
    <Warning>
      Avoid changing too many elements at once, or you won't know which change fixed the issue
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Your Adjusted Prompt">
    Evaluate how well your changes addressed the problem:
    
    - Compare the new output to the previous one
    - Check if the specific issue has been resolved
    - Look for any new issues that might have been introduced
    - Consider if further refinements are needed
    
    <Note>
      Testing frequently during development helps catch issues before they become complex problems
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Refine and Iterate">
    Continue making focused improvements:
    
    - Address any remaining or new issues one at a time
    - Keep a record of what changes worked and what didn't
    - Consider using Playlab's "Fix at the Point of Error" tool
    - Seek feedback from others to identify issues you might miss

## <Icon icon="timeline" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Example: Evolution of a Prompt

### Initial Prompt
<Card title="Initial Prompt" icon="circle-minus" color="#f44336">
  Create a history lesson plan about World War II for high school students.
</Card>

<Note>
  This prompt is too vague and doesn't provide enough specifics for the AI to generate a useful lesson plan.
</Note>

### Adding Structure
<Card title="Adding Structure" icon="arrow-up-right" color="#FF9800">
  Create a history lesson plan about World War II for high school students. Include:
  1. Lesson objectives
  2. Key topics to cover
  3. A timeline of major events
  4. Suggested activities
</Card>

<Note>
  We've added structure to the prompt, addressing the vagueness. However, it still lacks specificity about the content and doesn't guide the AI on the depth of information needed.
</Note>

### Specify Content and Depth
<Card title="Specify Content and Depth" icon="arrow-up-right" color="#FF9800">
  Create a history lesson plan about the causes and major events of World War II for 11th grade students. Include:
  1. 3-4 specific lesson objectives
  2. 5 key topics to cover, focusing on the European theater
  3. A timeline of 7-10 major events from 1939-1945
  4. 2-3 suggested activities, including one analytical writing task
</Card>

<Note>
  We've specified the focus (causes and major events), grade level, and added more details to each section. However, it doesn't address the need for engaging content or historical perspectives.
</Note>

### Add Engagement and Perspectives
<Card title="Add Engagement and Perspectives" icon="arrow-up-right" color="#FF9800">
  Create an engaging history lesson plan about the causes and major events of World War II for 11th grade students. Include:
  1. 3-4 specific lesson objectives that promote critical thinking
  2. 5 key topics to cover, focusing on the European theater
  3. A timeline of 7-10 major events from 1939-1945
  4. 2-3 suggested activities, including one analytical writing task and one group discussion
  5. 2-3 primary source excerpts to analyze
  6. Discussion questions that encourage students to consider multiple historical perspectives
</Card>

<Note>
  We've added elements to make the lesson more engaging and included primary sources and multiple perspectives. The prompt now guides the AI to create a more comprehensive and interactive lesson plan.
</Note>

### Ensure Accessibility and Assessment
<Card title="Ensure Accessibility and Assessment" icon="check" color="#4CAF50">
  Create an engaging and accessible history lesson plan about the causes and major events of World War II for 11th grade students, including accommodations for diverse learners. Include:
  1. 3-4 specific lesson objectives that promote critical thinking
  2. 5 key topics to cover, focusing on the European theater
  3. A timeline of 7-10 major events from 1939-1945
  4. 2-3 suggested activities, including one analytical writing task and one group discussion
  5. 2-3 primary source excerpts to analyze, with suggestions for scaffolding for struggling readers
  6. Discussion questions that encourage students to consider multiple historical perspectives
  7. One formative assessment idea to check for understanding
  8. A brief suggestion for differentiating the lesson for advanced and struggling learners
</Card>

<Note>
  In this final refinement, we've addressed accessibility and assessment, ensuring the lesson plan is inclusive and includes a way to check student understanding. The prompt now guides the AI to create a comprehensive, engaging, and adaptable lesson plan.

## <Icon icon="circle-question" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="How do I know which part of my prompt is causing the problem?">
  Identifying the problematic part of a prompt often requires systematic testing. Try removing or modifying different sections of your prompt one at a time to see which changes affect the output. You can also try asking the AI directly to explain which parts of your prompt might be causing confusion. The Playlab "Fix at the Point of Error" tool can help you be metacognitive about your prompt by analyzing potential sources of confusion.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my changes make the output worse instead of better?">
  This is a normal part of the prompt engineering process! If your changes make things worse, simply revert to the previous version and try a different approach. Keep a record of what you've tried and the results, so you can learn from each attempt. Remember that prompt engineering often involves some trial and error, even for experienced practitioners.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How small should my changes be when fixing a prompt?">
  As a general rule, make the smallest change that could reasonably fix the issue you've identified. If you change too many elements at once, you won't know which specific modification solved the problem. Think of it like debugging code—isolate variables and test one change at a time whenever possible.
