# Prompting Basics

Effective prompting is the key to getting the most out of AI, whether you're creating apps in Playlab or using them. Good prompts help you externalize your thinking and communicate clearly with AI systems.

<Info>
  **What is a Prompt?**
  
  A prompt is the input you give to an AI to guide its response. Think of it as a request or instruction that helps the AI understand what you want it to do or generate.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="🔨 Prompting as a Creator">
    When creating Playlab apps, how you craft your app's instructions is the foundation of your application. Your prompts are the blueprint that determines how your app will behave and serve your users.

    <Accordion title="Externalizing Your Thinking">
      When creating prompts for your Playlab app, you're essentially:
      - Translating your expertise into clear instructions the AI can follow
      - Defining the parameters of what makes a good response for your specific use case
      - Creating a framework for AI to follow that matches your mental model
      - Building guardrails that keep the AI focused on your intended purpose
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Playlab-Specific Considerations">
      Prompting in Playlab is particularly important because:
      - Your prompts define the entire user experience of your application
      - Well-crafted prompts create consistent, reliable results across different user inputs
      - The right prompting strategy can make complex tasks feel simple and intuitive for users
      - Effective prompts in Playlab can compensate for limitations in user input
    </Accordion>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="⌨️ Prompting as a User">
    When using Playlab apps, how you phrase your requests significantly impacts the quality of responses you receive.

    <Accordion title="Externalizing Your Needs">
      Good prompts help you:
      - Clarify what you're actually looking for
      - Break down complex questions into manageable parts
      - Provide necessary context that might not be obvious
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Effective User Prompting">
      <Accordion title="Be Specific and Clear">
        - **Poor**: "Help with my essay"
        - **Better**: "I'm writing an essay comparing renewable energy sources. Can you help me outline three key differences between solar and wind power?"
        
        Being specific helps the AI understand exactly what you need, saving time and producing more relevant responses.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Provide Context">
        - **Poor**: "What's the answer to question 5?"
        - **Better**: "I'm working on a 7th-grade geometry worksheet about calculating the area of irregular shapes. For question 5, I need to find the area of this composite figure [description]. Here's my approach so far..."
        
        Context helps the AI understand your situation and provide appropriate guidance.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Ask Follow-up Questions">
        - If the initial response isn't quite what you need, refine your request
        - Build on previous interactions: "That's helpful, but could you explain more about..."
        - Specify what aspect you want expanded: "Can you elaborate on the third point about energy storage?"
      </Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long should my prompts be?">
  Effective prompts can be short or long depending on the task. For simple tasks, a concise prompt may be sufficient. For complex tasks requiring specific formatting or thinking patterns, longer prompts with examples and clear instructions are often better.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my Playlab app isn't responding the way I expected?">
  If your app isn't producing the expected responses, try these Playlab-specific strategies:
  
  1. **Review your base prompt**: Check your main app instructions for clarity and specificity
  2. **Test with the references toggle**: Turn references on and off to see if they're helping or hindering
  3. **Examine starter inputs**: Ensure they're guiding users to provide the right information
  4. **Add explicit guardrails**: Include instructions about what the app should NOT do
  5. **Use the test console**: Playlab's testing environment lets you try different inputs and refine your prompts
  6. **Check for conflicting instructions**: Make sure different parts of your prompt don't contradict each other
  
  Remember that in Playlab, your prompt is the foundation of your entire application, so spending time refining it is worth the investment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use the same prompting techniques for different AI tools?">
  While the fundamental principles of clear communication apply across different AI systems, each may have specific strengths, limitations, and preferred formats. What works well in Playlab might need adjustments for other AI tools.
