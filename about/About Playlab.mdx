We are a 501c3 nonprofit organization devoted to creating a future where educators and students around the world have the agency to not just use AI, but to shape it. On their terms. As part of a global community working to improve education.

## <Icon icon="people-group" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Who We Are

Playlab is a community of educators, technologists, and learners committed to democratizing AI in education. We believe that AI literacy should be accessible to everyone, and that the people who use educational tools should have a voice in how they're designed.

## <Icon icon="heart" size="24" className="inline-block align-text-bottom" /> Our Values

We're at the start of the AI era. We believe an open-source, community-driven approach is key to harnessing AI in education. We're a community of learners, supporting each other in creating, experimenting, and using AI.

<Tip>
  **AI isn't magic... it's math**
  
  Understanding the fundamental principles behind AI demystifies it and empowers you to use it effectively. Behind every AI system are algorithms and data that you can learn to understand!
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **AI has both great potential and great risks**
  
  We explore AI's possibilities while critically examining its limitations and ethical implications. Every AI tool comes with tradeoffs. Learn to identify both opportunities and challenges!
</Warning>

<Info>
  **To learn about AI, you have to play with AI in community**
  
  Hands-on experimentation and collaborative learning create deeper understanding than passive consumption. Your questions and insights help everyone learn better. Don't be afraid to experiment!
</Info>

<Note>
  **You're already an AI person**
  
  Everyone interacts with AI daily, and everyone deserves the right to learn how to shape how AI can affect our lives. You will build your AI intuition over time as you become a critical consumer and creator of AI.
