Go further in your AI journey by joining a Playlab Professional Learning Community (PLC). We offer two pathways for educators around the world to come together, explore AI, build custom apps, and learn from each other based on their experience and interests.

**All learning communities are open to the public and free.**

Browse our offerings and sign up below. We'll follow up with calendar invites later this month. **We'd love to have you join for any you are interested in!**

*Keep an eye out for potential domain-specific Communities of Practice that may be announced later this fall.*
