title: "Summer Communities of Learning"
description: "Join our summer PLCs and Communities of Practice to explore AI, build custom apps, and learn with our growing Playlab community."
---

Go further in your AI journey by joining a Playlab Professional Learning Community (PLC) or Community of Practice. We offer three pathways for educators around the world to come together, explore AI, build custom apps, and learn from each other based on their experience and interests.

**All learning communities are open to the public and free.** After completing a learning series with us, you'll receive a digital certificate to share on your resume and LinkedIn.

Browse our offerings and sign up below. We'll follow up with calendar invites later this month. **We'd love to have you join for any you are interested in!**
